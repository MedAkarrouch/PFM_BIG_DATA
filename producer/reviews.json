{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B0002E382Q","helpful":[3,4],"overall":3.0,"reviewText":"These cables work very well at transmitting sound. So why only three stars? Well, these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find. These are stiff, thick, and heavy. While that's good for most analog cables, these cables are so stiff and heavy that, for instance, a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there.With so many amps having plastic jacks these days, you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard-mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one. I mean, let's face it. You never know what will happen at a gig. Sometimes you're playing with a 12 foot cable when you should have a 18 foot cable. A cable shouldn't come out because of a gentle pull, but if it's between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it, you want the cable to fall out. If everything you have is heavy or Velcro'd to the ground, this isn't a problem, but it is for me. I feel like when you're playing with these cables, you're worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out, but because it's seriously like a trip wire out there.Lastly, these plugs are huge. That's not really a problem if you play a Strat or a Tele, but what about a P-Bass or a J-Bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body? This is going to stick out a lot, and to loop it around your strap, it's going to be a huge, stiff, cumbersome loop. I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for those kinds of instruments, but most normal straight plugs do just fine. So yeah, if you like to move around on stage, get more flexible cables. You'll thank me.These cables are just poorly thought out. They'd work great as patch cords, or keyboards, drum machines, from pedal board to amp (as long as you have a metal jack). Monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for actual instrument use, and at that price, Pro Co cables are also excellent, and they have brand name plugs, as well.","reviewTime":"08 27, 2012","reviewerID":"ACWH4WJMC5UFN","reviewerName":"H.

So if you're like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing, you should try a Dynamic Mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a little.I did an A \/ B test against the SM7B I just bought and the SM57 (I love) for vocals - with the exact same processing chain, cable, settings, etc. and just switched the mics out. I sung the same passage as well, and I have to say - the SM57 sounds muddy in comparison to the SM7B. If I didn't have this new microphone I would still like the SM57, but the Genni is out of the bottle now... so not going back. The SM7B is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very well.DYNAMIC SINGERS ( Rock, Jazz, GOSPEL, OPERA )= If you have the budget get this SM7B and if you don't, buy the SM57 until you do have the budget.QUIET SINGERS (ACOUSTIC , FOLK ) = If you sing softly all of the time you really don't need one of these dynamic mics, and would be better off with the standard Large Condenser mics as listed above.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B000OY4WDI","helpful":[1,1],"overall":2.0,"reviewText":"SummaryAcoustic sounds &#34;ok&#34;, but noisy in weird ways. I returned it. Price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.Pros- Boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable- standard 9V power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs.- variety of acoustic sounds possible. (personally, I only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)Cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- While I have several Boss pedals, I think they always make the knobs too small and the font\/print too small. I prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.Details:The basic concept is good. I had an AC-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. It wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. It was also just noisy in the pedal chain. Adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. However, I sold that model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound. At the time, the AC-2's were selling for about $85 new. Boss since redesigned AND raised the price significantly on the AC-3.I bought the AC-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the AC-2 -- and they did, a little. But not enough to keep it. I returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. I think the AC-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and\/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.I opted for a Behringer acoustic modeller instead. They make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;. The 400 has reverb on the pedal. I opted for the 300 and got it for $25. I expect the durability will be lower on the Behringer than the Boss as it has a plastic case. However, this is an effect I pull out just once in a while and since I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 Behringers for the price of a Boss....if it breaks...I'll just buy another.I also have a Boss GT-100 multi-effects unit. You can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the Behringer or out of the Boss AC-3. The least cost effective of those choices is the AC-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.I'm not saying its a bad pedal, I'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. If they would fix the noise issues, I might have even kept it. I did opt to keep the Behringer for those times I'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. This Boss pedal just didn't work that well for me.","reviewTime":"03 2, 2014","reviewerID":"A20JJ8634DG3FS","reviewerName":"Johnny Guitar \"J.F. Guitar\"","summary":"Bought it - returned it.

We we can debate why that is but one thing for certain is it is tough to get an accurate idea of what an LP will sound like till after you unbox it.  After hours of research I decided on the FD2 since it seemed to have a lot of tuning options and I actually found a review using an LP into a clean amp.[...]Essentially, you get 3 modes which have varing degrees types of OD and a second boost mode to push things even father.  What I liked about this pedal is you can use the comp cut or flat mids with an LP and not increase the bottom end or mids which often Teles or Strats need.  Hence, you can go from slight boost to huge gain without turning into mud like some pedals will do.  The only downside is with so many options you will constantly be playing with the knobs and switches and finding new sounds.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B001SC4I16","helpful":[0,0],"overall":3.0,"reviewText":"The U-30 is a decent starter's ukulele, no matter what color you get, but it is not without its flaws. The tuners feel cheap, but they are functional, much better than friction tuners on \"toy\" ukuleles. The body paint is of good quality and resists scratches with ease, but the paint on the fretboard comes off easily unto your fingers. The string action is low, making it perfect for fast strum patterns. Even for a soprano ukulele, this one has a higher pitched sound with little sustain, which is actually quite authentic for those desiring a more \"Hawaiian\" sound, but the tiny sound and low sustain make playing along with other instruments problematic, unless using a microphone. The worst aspect of this ukulele are the strings, it takes forever to stretch them or \"break them in.\" This means that you must tune your ukulele virtually after every song, so beginning ukulele players should remember to get a chromatic tuner. Chords that use the first fret, such as F and A sound distorted for some reason. Replacing the included strings with Aquila strings makes this ukulele much better, but the added cost puts it in the price range of what I would consider a true starter's ukulele, the Lanikai LU-11.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B002DC8OE2","helpful":[2,2],"overall":5.0,"reviewText":"The reason they are called silk and phosphor is that the wound strings have silk along with steel in their cores (the wire around which the windings are wound) rather than just steel.  This allows them to tune to pitch with less tension, so they can be the ideal string for a beginner or someone who is moving from nylon.  There are also silk and steel strings with silver plated copper windings.  The lower tensions and light gauges mean that they may not drive some guitar tops hard enough to let them perform up to their capability.  That is, they may sound soft and cheap.  I would not put them on most Martin dreadnoughts, for example.  But they may work fine on lightly braced guitars. The only way to find out for sure is to experiment.These are an experiment for me, I usually use silk-and-steel on my guitar banjo, it was time to change strings, and I stumbled across these.  I'll have to see where things settle down, but so far I'm willing to give these silk-and-phosphor the nod over silk-and-steel.  The sound is a bit brighter.  My music partner says she prefers the way these silk-and-phosphor blend with her fiddle.This is so \"out there\" that I won't let it influence my rating.  My guitar-banjo's tailpiece has small holes through which the strings must pass.  The ends of the windings at the bottoms of the bare steel 1st and 2nd strings stick out a bit, so I had trouble putting them on.  I was able to use a fine wire cutter to nip the end of the 1st string, but it didn't work for the 2nd string.  I ended up using a D'Addario string of the same gauge in its place.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B0038MTH8S","helpful":[2,3],"overall":5.0,"reviewText":"This is my first tube amp and after doing a TON of research, I found that the VOX AC15C1 was just about perfect for me.It came down to the AC15, Fender Blues Jr. and the Ibanez TS15. The Blues Jr. has a somewhat small enclosure for a 1x12 and I felt it had a bit of a \"boxy\" tone, otherwise, it's a great amp. The Ibanez has a classic Tube Screamer circuit built in and a switch which cuts the wattage in half for playing at lower volumes, but it lacked a reverb circuit, which was a deal breaker (silly reasoning, I know). The AC15 has a larger enclosure than the Blues Jr., and it has a reverb AND tremolo circuit, so it had the features I was looking for and most importantly, it produces some killer tone.If you've ever seen or read a review of this amp, chances are, you've heard about the classic VOX \"chime\", which this amp has, but I fell in love with the natural tube saturation on the top boost channel right away. The normal channel will break up nicely too, but I would suggest an A\/B switch and run the normal channel fairly clean and the top boost pretty dirty.I was worried at first that 15 watts wouldn't be enough, but fear not, this amp is LOUD... maybe too loud as I'm just a hobbyist that plays in the bedroom, but that's not a bad thing. It totally blows away my 100 watt Marshall solid state and I haven't put the volume much past 8 O'clock for fear that my wife may beat me to death if I do.While there is no effects loop, it takes pedals well, but for distorted tones, I've found myself just plugging straight in just to get the unadulterated tube crunch, which I've come to love so much. As stated above, the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp, or as previously stated, running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an A\/B switch to go between them. As far as other effects, I really like what it does to my TC Electronic Flashback Delay and Corona Chorus. Note that there is a foot switch jack in the back panel, but it controls the on\/off for the built in tremolo and reverb, but it's sadly not included with the amp.For my first tube amp, I don't think I could have done much better; I love the tone that I can get, the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp, it's feature rich, and takes pedals well. The other two amps that I was considering were a little less expensive, and while I really feel that the VOX is just a better all around amp, I don't think you can go wrong with any one of the three.The weight (about 50 lbs), and the lack of an included foot switch are really the only two cons that I can think of. While I would have picked up all three of the amps that I was looking at if I had the means, I would not hesitate to recommend this amp to anyone looking for their first or next tube amp.","reviewTime":"07 28, 2012","reviewerID":"A1F4KCBVDP8S25","reviewerName":"Adam","summary":"Great tube amp!","unixReviewTime":1343433600,"full_review":"great tube amp this is my first tube amp and after doing a ton of research i found that the vox ac c was just about perfect for me it came down to the ac fender blues jr and the ibanez ts the blues jr has a somewhat small enclosure for a x and i felt it had a bit of a boxy tone otherwise it s a great amp the ibanez has a classic tube screamer circuit built in and a switch which cuts the wattage in half for playing at lower volumes but it lacked a reverb circuit which was a deal breaker silly reasoning i know the ac has a larger enclosure than the blues jr and it has a reverb and tremolo circuit so it had the features i was looking for and most importantly it produces some killer tone if you ve ever seen or read a review of this amp chances are you ve heard about the classic vox chime which this amp has but i fell in love with the natural tube saturation on the top boost channel right away the normal channel will break up nicely too but i would suggest an a b switch and run the normal channel fairly clean and the top boost pretty dirty i was worried at first that watts wouldn t be enough but fear not this amp is loud maybe too loud as i m just a hobbyist that plays in the bedroom but that s not a bad thing it totally blows away my watt marshall solid state and i haven t put the volume much past o clock for fear that my wife may beat me to death if i do while there is no effects loop it takes pedals well but for distorted tones i ve found myself just plugging straight in just to get the unadulterated tube crunch which i ve come to love so much as stated above the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp or as previously stated running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an a b switch to go between them as far as other effects i really like what it does to my tc electronic flashback delay and corona chorus note that there is a foot switch jack in the back panel but it controls the on off for the built in tremolo and reverb but it s sadly not included with the amp for my first tube amp i don t think i could have done much better i love the tone that i can get the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp it s feature rich and takes pedals well the other two amps that i was considering were a little less expensive and while i really feel that the vox is just a better all around amp i don t think you can go wrong with any one of the three the weight about lbs and the lack of an included foot switch are really the only two cons that i can think of while i would have picked up all three of the amps that i was looking at if i had the means i would not hesitate to recommend this amp to anyone looking for their first or next tube amp","label":0},

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B005FKF1PY","helpful":[4,5],"overall":3.0,"reviewText":"I'll be upfront and honest right away and say that I'm not the biggest fan of headstock tuners.  I love the idea, but usually I feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired.  But when this popped up on my Vine newsletter I thought I'd give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things I don't like about the other ones (*COUGH*snark*COUGH*).A little background first, I guess.  I've been playing guitar for the last 9 years, and I currently have two other tuners.  I have a little Korg plug in type,  where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up.  I also have a Boss TU-3 pedal tuner.  If I'm jamming with friends or playing a show, the TU-3 is what I'll use to stay in tune.  Its very durable and accurate, and I like how I can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal, so I can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and\/or the audience.  For home practice I use the Korg, as I usually tune up before I start playing, then just plug into my practice amp and blast away.  The Korg is nice and accurate, easy enough to use for alternate tunings, and in 9 years of having it around (including in and out of jam sessions before buying the TU-3) I've only had to buy one replacement.I first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue Snark that everyone seems to have these days.  He was not incredibly pleased with it.  Not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock, it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn't exatly easy to tune up with it.  While I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool, it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something I'd want on my headstock.Enter this Mini Headstock Tuner by Planet Waves.  Does it fix the problems that made the Snark so unappealing to my friend and me?1.  Accuracy:  It does seem to tune accurately, that's a good thing, and it already puts this ahead of the Snark.  Its not easy to use for alternate tunings however, so do keep that in mind.  Also, the letters take some getting used to, as they use that kind of chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players.  Not a huge complaint, but it isn't as idiot proof as my Korg or TU-3.2.  Looks\/Ease Of Use:  It's quite a bit more subtle than the Snark, able to hide behind your headstock, which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar.  The only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a Les Paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side, you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen.  My LP copy has the larger Grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock.  I wear my guitar fairly low, so I was able find an area where I can see it from the top down, but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck.  Those with Fender style headstocks should have no problem, though, it'll work great for them.  Also, it is plenty bright, so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue.3.  Durability:  This is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are.  The Snark is very easy to break, as it rests on a small ball joint.  This Planet Waves mini isn't going to lose its head too easy, but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold up under too much use.  The tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too, so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it would be easy enough to break.  I haven't had it long enough for this to happen yet, so I can only give you my initial impressions.  Let's just say this, I'd never gig with this guy as my only tuner.  Its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use.All in all, it is a better headstock choice than the Snark.  However, headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they're gonna work for everyone.  Anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest a Boss TU-2 or TU-3 or a Korg Pitchblack).  I know they're more expensive, but you'll be happier off in the long run.  Those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session, this is a nice option.  But it may not hold up forever.I'll probably stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug in, but as headstock tuners go, this is nicer than most.","reviewTime":"10 26, 2011","reviewerID":"A27L5L6I7OSV5B","reviewerName":"Otto Correct","summary":"Its good for what it is, but they're not great yet...","unixReviewTime":1319587200,"full_review":"its good for what it is but they re not great yet i ll be upfront and honest right away and say that i m not the biggest fan of headstock tuners i love the idea but usually i feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired but when this popped up on my vine newsletter i thought i d give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things i don t like about the other ones cough snark cough a little background first i guess i ve been playing guitar for the last years and i currently have two other tuners i have a little korg plug in type where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up i also have a boss tu pedal tuner if i m jamming with friends or playing a show the tu is what i ll use to stay in tune its very durable and accurate and i like how i can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal so i can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and or the audience for home practice i use the korg as i usually tune up before i start playing then just plug into my practice amp and blast away the korg is nice and accurate easy enough to use for alternate tunings and in years of having it around including in and out of jam sessions before buying the tu i ve only had to buy one replacement i first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue snark that everyone seems to have these days he was not incredibly pleased with it not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn t exatly easy to tune up with it while i thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something i d want on my headstock enter this mini headstock tuner by planet waves does it fix the problems that made the snark so unappealing to my friend and me accuracy it does seem to tune accurately that s a good thing and it already puts this ahead of the snark its not easy to use for alternate tunings however so do keep that in mind also the letters take some getting used to as they use that kind of chunky lcd block style that you find on some dvd players not a huge complaint but it isn t as idiot proof as my korg or tu looks ease of use it s quite a bit more subtle than the snark able to hide behind your headstock which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar the only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a les paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen my lp copy has the larger grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock i wear my guitar fairly low so i was able find an area where i can see it from the top down but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck those with fender style headstocks should have no problem though it ll work great for them also it is plenty bright so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue durability this is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are the snark is very easy to break as it rests on a small ball joint this planet waves mini isn t going to lose its head too easy but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and i don t expect it to hold up under too much use the tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session i still think it would be easy enough to break i haven t had it long enough for this to happen yet so i can only give you my initial impressions let s just say this i d never gig with this guy as my only tuner its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use all in all it is a better headstock choice than the snark however headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they re gonna work for everyone anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner i personally suggest a boss tu or tu or a korg pitchblack i know they re more expensive but you ll be happier off in the long run those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session this is a nice option but it may not hold up forever i ll probably stick to my tu and my korg plug in but as headstock tuners go this is nicer than most","label":2},

Ive only broken 1 pick and it was cracked when i got it. I started reading all these great reviews how the dunlop tortex was great so i ran down an bought some thins. The tip is a little more rounded. I tried them and they feel alright but the fenders were louder and brighter sounding no doubt about it. So its back to the fenders. Also something i learned is when i play a guitar that has a dark pickguard i use a light colored pick (pearloid) and a red pick for a white pickguard. The contrast helps you see what your doing.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B0007GGUGA","helpful":[0,0],"overall":3.0,"reviewText":"Most of the time I am able to use the G7 capo with one hand when moving it, adjusting it, and clamping it in place. However, sometimes I have to use both hands to squeeze it in place so the strings don't buzz. That may seem like not such a big deal, but I prefer to have an easier one to work with. I have small hands, and an old carpal injury, so I prefer to have as little strain as possible to place the capo. This one is better than the any of the clasping kinds (Keysers, etc) in that respect. After a couple of playing sessions, I figured out how best to use this capo with just one hand most of the time. Now that I've learned how best to use it, I'll keep it. When I first got it I was upset that I had to use 2 hands and forcible squeezing to put in place, but now I've learned how to work it better so that I can do most of it with one hand without too much strain.A capo should: be easy to remove and put on, stay in tune, not hurt the hands (no 2 handed squeezing), not interfere with playing when inserted, and it shouldn't break too soon (have at least several months to a year before breaking if at all).On the plus side, this unit seems pretty well made, so it should last a long time. I think it meets all the criteria except for having to squeeze it tight periodically.I've tried so many capos now, and the only ones I liked were the Planet Waves screw tops, they are easy to use, easy to move from fret to fret, light on the hands, stay in tune and out of the way, but they break in damp California weather (I've had 4 of them break on me, within a couple months. They snap and go airborn, which is dangerous). Next I'll try the Dunlop Victor capos, they are screw tops similar in style to the Planet Waves (Dunlop also makes the Planet Waves capos), but they are made with more durable bronze, so they should last longer, and I hope those will be the best for me. I also ordered an aluminum version of the Planet Waves in hopes it won't break like their thermoplastic ones do.If you have small hands like me, and don't want to strain the hands while playing, like me, then that rules out the Kysers and any of the squeezing type of capos. The Shubs fall off and are a hassle all around to take off and on and adjust, and the springtop ones are suspect as well. That's why I like the screwtops that don't get in the way and are easy to adjust. Ok, I hope the Dunlop Victor will do the job for me now, I'll try it next.","reviewTime":"10 4, 2012","reviewerID":"A1LCG14GZJI5LO","reviewerName":"Andrew M.","summary":"Pretty good capo, but not perfect","unixReviewTime":1349308800,"full_review":"pretty good capo but not perfect most of the time i am able to use the g capo with one hand when moving it adjusting it and clamping it in place however sometimes i have to use both hands to squeeze it in place so the strings don t buzz that may seem like not such a big deal but i prefer to have an easier one to work with i have small hands and an old carpal injury so i prefer to have as little strain as possible to place the capo this one is better than the any of the clasping kinds keysers etc in that respect after a couple of playing sessions i figured out how best to use this capo with just one hand most of the time now that i ve learned how best to use it i ll keep it when i first got it i was upset that i had to use hands and forcible squeezing to put in place but now i ve learned how to work it better so that i can do most of it with one hand without too much strain a capo should be easy to remove and put on stay in tune not hurt the hands no handed squeezing not interfere with playing when inserted and it shouldn t break too soon have at least several months to a year before breaking if at all on the plus side this unit seems pretty well made so it should last a long time i think it meets all the criteria except for having to squeeze it tight periodically i ve tried so many capos now and the only ones i liked were the planet waves screw tops they are easy to use easy to move from fret to fret light on the hands stay in tune and out of the way but they break in damp california weather i ve had of them break on me within a couple months they snap and go airborn which is dangerous next i ll try the dunlop victor capos they are screw tops similar in style to the planet waves dunlop also makes the planet waves capos but they are made with more durable bronze so they should last longer and i hope those will be the best for me i also ordered an aluminum version of the planet waves in hopes it won t break like their thermoplastic ones do if you have small hands like me and don t want to strain the hands while playing like me then that rules out the kysers and any of the squeezing type of capos the shubs fall off and are a hassle all around to take off and on and adjust and the springtop ones are suspect as well that s why i like the screwtops that don t get in the way and are easy to adjust ok i hope the dunlop victor will do the job for me now i ll try it next","label":2},
{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B0007ORM0K","helpful":[1,1],"overall":5.0,"reviewText":"I bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my Hondo II \"The Paul\", which I bought in 1980. The stock ones were loose, lots of backlash in the worm gears, and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still new.They went in easily, if you follow this hint( if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged, disregard this hint)- The holes for the old machine heads on the Hondo II were 0.305\" in diameter, and these new Grovers need a 0.390\" diameter hole. So I had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes. It's almost impossible to use a drill, even in a drill press, without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock. I read online suggestions about using a round wood file, and reamer, etc.. So what I did was first use a threading tap( for metal screw threads) which at the bottom had a 0.290\" diameter, and at the top had a 0.375\" diameter. This is a standard 3\/8\"-24 threading tap. I chucked the tap into my battery-powered hand drill, set to low speed, and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to 0.375\" in diameter. Then I used a tapered reamer, from both sides, to enlarge the holes to the required diameter. Quick, clean, easy. If you have a different size enlargement to make, use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to 0.390\" diameter.Another hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time, like when changing strings. You don't want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod. At least I don't want to!Now the guitar stays in tune, and is easier and more accurate to tune.A very worthwhile upgrade!

I'm loyal to the audio community and the industry has already put one of my kids through college.I see half of this stand as being just fine but the boom is not very good. I particularly don't think the horizontal axis point is very good, I mean where you adjust the angle of the boom. It's a cheap version of a simple design and I suspect the day will come that you're trying to figure how to keep it from drooping, the problem being that the surface area is much smaller creating less friction and more tightening until something's got to give. The tightening screws to slide it also seem pretty poor and I'd predict someday you'll be going from duct tape to replacing it. I base this more on my experience in sound reinforcement, which is harder on equipment than recording and because I own both types of businesses. The boom in general isn't a nice one and will always be 32 inches because it isn't telescoping and uses a pretend plastic counterweight, so you're mainly purchasing the stand. On Stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series.9701B Pro Tripod Microphone Boom StandJust like you can't compare the price of a used compact car with a new full size pickup, this one is so inexpensive (too inexpensive?) that price comparisons aren't what's important, so looking at Amazon today I'd probably buy the 9700MS9701TB TeleBoom Microphone Standor this one,DR Pro Mic Stand Telescoping Boomor maybe try this oneHosa MSB-521BK Mic Stand with BoomI haven't tried that stand but since Hosa generally sells good inexpensive products I'd be inclined to give it a try. I think you'll end up spending more money on your next stand and you might as well do it once instead of twice. I'd pay attention to the 2 and 3 star reviews because you'll find more from experienced users and the most helpful 5 star do not say how long they've been using it but love how inexpensive it is. Ignore that it doesn't come with a mic clip because usually they don't, clips come with microphones or can be purchased separately. All but the best stands will fall over when unbalanced, so plan on putting weight on a leg if you're using a heavy mic like a condenser or spending a lot more money. $100+ will buy you a studio boom although a counterweight, like what's used on a cymbal boom will help any boom stand and could be created with a little imagination. As for the cheap cord clips, just forget them and buy these, they'll attach to a stand or cord and work excellent (no leftover duct tape glue).Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping TiesBut understand my position, I've got stands purchased 20 years ago that I can still use and don't feel the lowest price is always the best value, but you're intelligent so you know an $80 stand used for 20 years is $4\/year, I use stands almost everyday and I don't think this would last me a year and maybe only months. But if1. You don't care about a telescoping boom and2. You don't plan to adjust it much and3. You use a average weight mic or4. You're alright with replacing the boom when neededThis stand could be fine for you now if you can't budget a higher quality stand and it will surely work for some.

I've played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:- The Seagull is comparatively unattractive. Its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- The cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard\/bridge on mine are very nice.- The laminate sides\/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;\/resonant during playing.- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK.- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I've not encountered before.- I can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!All in all, it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it's made in Canada for Asian\/Mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. In fact, for the price range, I can get a just-as-good Asian\/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back\/front, Sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.I don't regret getting it, but I feel like I overpaid for what I received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price.

I also tend not to like fuzz as an effect.  I'd characterize this box as a cross between distortion and fuzz, maintaining enough definition for chord work.  If you're reading the reviews, you've probably already done your research on the features, but I'll cover them anyway.Three simple controls, Volume - Tone - Sustain, with the Sustain control being more or less a Gain control.  The enclosure is a smaller, pedalboard-friendly size.  The pedal incorporates two of the (supposedly) most popular Big Muff mods with switches, Tone and Wicker.  When Tone is switched off, the Tone control and its tone-shaping circuitry are completely disconnected.  In this mode, the distortion applies to the entire tonal spectrum evenly, and it also produces a significant volume boost.  The Tone knob does nothing.When Wicker is switched on, it removes three high-frequency rolloff filters that were added to the original Big Muff circuit to smooth out the sound.  Disconnecting these makes the sound a bit raspier and rougher, with a high-end frequency boost.I use this pedal running into a mild overdrive, the Catalinbread Dirty Little Secret, which \"conditions\" the signal.  I play with the Tone off and Wicker on, and even with the Volume and Sustain controls set fairly low, this combination results in a wonderfully thick, massive distorted tone that is still pretty smooth.If you're looking to get a Big Muff, and you're not a snob about which version, the switchable mods on this one are really great for experimenting to find your own sound.  Not to mention that, at this price point, it will be much cheaper than some vintage Muffs.  Highly recommended.","reviewTime":"09 19, 2010","reviewerID":"A2ZYE710E5YYCW","reviewerName":"Ian M.

It is powered via the USB bus, so you don't have to carry power supplies, or worry about finding an outlet for the device.One issue is that this is not a plug-and-play device.  You will need to install a device driver in order for your computer to recognize it.  After the driver was installed, I was able to get Pro Tools to recognize it right away without any issue.  I recorded some tracks just to see how easy it was to work with and how it sounded.  It works like any other interface in Pro Tools, so you will be able to use it easily enough.  The mic pre-amps don't seem terribly powerful and you will have to really up the input level to get anything out of a 48v condenser microphone like the ones I use to record vocals and guitars.  I found that the overall sound quality was okay, but just okay. I wouldn't want to use this for anything important, but it will work fine if you are doing a field recording of rehearsals, or doing pre-production in a practice space.  I wouldn't recommend it for serious studio work though and I would rather drag my Pro Tools I\/O rack to a location if I was in the field.The build quality is a bit suspect on this as well.  I noticed that the unit made a clinking noise when I picked it up after taking it out of the box.  It seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B00GTSM8FW","helpful":[3,3],"overall":5.0,"reviewText":"I have been playing guitar for more years than I care to admit. Okay I bought a 1966 Telecaster brand new back then. Still have it and love it. I have a lot of different guitars, mostly electric, and 4 acoustics. On my electrics I love extra light 8 gauge strings. (Only about 5% of us do) I can fly on those and do things at a pace this is a lot more difficult with heavier gauge strings. Anyhow I digress, but for a reason. Light gauge strings are subject to tuning problems if you have big fat frets like the .050&#34; found on Gibons and ESP-LTD's. When you squeeze the string to fret it, with light gauge strings it is all too easy to squeeze it all the way to the fret board. With X-Large jumbo frets that can be quite a distance making the guitar go out of tune. The cure for that is using heavier gauge strings such as 10's or more so it makes it possible to determine quite easily just where the top of the fret is without doing the full squeeze all the way to the fret board. So most capo's work with 10's and on up because there is a lot more tension on the strings. So a lot of capos can create a comfortable fit fully fretting the strings without them going into the sharp note zone.So since I use lighter gauge strings, and even 9's are subject to the same limitation, I have had a hard time finding a capo that would sit comfortably at the top of the range between the fret and the board, and still squeeze the string sufficiently so as to not create any buzz and do so without making the string too sharp. Guess what? Now I found it. I have several capos and none of them make the grade for light gauge strings except this one. To be honest with you I was surprised when it worked.Okay so here is how I put it to the test. I used the Snark headstock tuner which is a great little tuner if you know the secret to using it. I also have the Peterson HD tuner bench model which is fodder for another post with its one tenth of one cent tuning accuracy. Okay back to the explanation.With the Snark you tune the open string until the line stays in the center without wavering off to one side. The only problem is that most any headstock tuner I have seen they aren't superbly accurate. (The Peterson headstock tuner I sent back because it was acting crazy. Anyhow...) So the secret to using the Snark which I like best out of the headstock tuners I have tried is to tune the open string first, and then fret the string on let's say the 5th fret. You will occasionally find that a string in the open position registers as being in tune, even though it may be a little sharp, or a little flat, so when you strum the whole chord you will get a desire to tune it, so your ears can hear it, in order to get it spot on. There is nothing more beautiful than a perfectly tuned guitar, and nothing worse than one that is well out of tune.So by tuning the open string, and then tuning the fretted string, once both are in tune it is right on. So in the open position if by chance it is a tiny bit sharp, not enough to register on the tuner, when you fret that string, for example on the 5th fret that naturally stretches the string a little bit, making it sharper, which will now show on the Snark as a note that is too sharp. Once you balance the open string, and the fretted string you really have a wonderfully tuned instrument. You don't even need to hear it. So your audience is not listening to you tune up, yet you get it right in the sweet spot that we all love and know so well.So with that being said you can more fully understand why this D'Addario NS Artist Capo is the cat&#8217;s meow. It is the first tuner that I ever used that kept the guitar perfectly in tune after clamping it on the neck. (It is adjustable like the others are, but this one is sensitive for light gauge strings as well)You often see artists trimming up their tuning after putting on the capo; not with this one even with light gauge strings. I must admit I was surprised taking it right out of the wrapper, after going through the above tuning procedure to get the guitar spot on, that it immediately did the job just right. It wasn't even a little bit sharp.To be super critical here is another tip. When using this capo put it closer to the fret, rather than in the middle between two frets. For some reason it stretches the string less in doing so. It has to do with the tension resistance at a steeper angle right alongside of a fret, rather than farther way like in the middle between the two frets. I did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets. (With 8 gauge strings)Since the two most important factors are that it is comfortable to use, not getting in the way when playing open chords and keeping the guitar in tune. The best way to use this capo is to simply clamp the strings right above the second fret for example, rather than right below the third one. Right below the third one gives you that perfect tune also, just like right above the second one does, but it keeps the capo way out of your way. As a matter of fact I am so accustomed to using the capo position to know where to finger the chords, that I sometimes make a mistake and fret them one lower than they belong. With a little practice, or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that. To say this quite simply is to say use this capo farther away from your hand. You just slide it down to being right above the fret below it, rather than right below the fret above it.So there it is. This Capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp. Of course if it can accurately handle 8's it will breeze through anything thicker. Out of the box it is set at its lightest setting, and that is perfect for 8's on the Telecaster I tried it on. Teles and Strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks. So it will work the same with both.So I guess I can't recommend this capo high enough since it is the ONLY one that works perfectly with super light gauge strings. My only problem is being sure to remember which guitar case it is in so I can switch it over when using a different guitar. I might get another one for a backup.","reviewTime":"06 14, 2014","reviewerID":"A14JBDSWKPKTZA","reviewerName":"Bob Feeser \"MillCrafters.com\"","summary":"Finally Found my Capo - This One is It - Look No Further","unixReviewTime":1402704000,"full_review":"finally found my capo this one is it look no further i have been playing guitar for more years than i care to admit okay i bought a telecaster brand new back then still have it and love it i have a lot of different guitars mostly electric and acoustics on my electrics i love extra light gauge strings only about of us do i can fly on those and do things at a pace this is a lot more difficult with heavier gauge strings anyhow i digress but for a reason light gauge strings are subject to tuning problems if you have big fat frets like the found on gibons and esp ltd s when you squeeze the string to fret it with light gauge strings it is all too easy to squeeze it all the way to the fret board with x large jumbo frets that can be quite a distance making the guitar go out of tune the cure for that is using heavier gauge strings such as s or more so it makes it possible to determine quite easily just where the top of the fret is without doing the full squeeze all the way to the fret board so most capo s work with s and on up because there is a lot more tension on the strings so a lot of capos can create a comfortable fit fully fretting the strings without them going into the sharp note zone so since i use lighter gauge strings and even s are subject to the same limitation i have had a hard time finding a capo that would sit comfortably at the top of the range between the fret and the board and still squeeze the string sufficiently so as to not create any buzz and do so without making the string too sharp guess what now i found it i have several capos and none of them make the grade for light gauge strings except this one to be honest with you i was surprised when it worked okay so here is how i put it to the test i used the snark headstock tuner which is a great little tuner if you know the secret to using it i also have the peterson hd tuner bench model which is fodder for another post with its one tenth of one cent tuning accuracy okay back to the explanation with the snark you tune the open string until the line stays in the center without wavering off to one side the only problem is that most

It sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches.As for using pedals with it, it will take distortion to a degree. It reaches a point, if pushed too hard, at which the definition of the distortion will begin turning mushy and shrill. You can use a distortion + overdrive to decent effect, especially if you are running a cleaner sounding OD like a Tube Screamer. I don't think it would do so well with a Bad Monkey, for example, though, which has more dirt in the tones it produces. I don't have a fuzz box (not yet, but have one on order), but I think most fuzzes will sound like crap unless you use a relatively cleaner, sweeter one like the Red Witch Fuzz God or the Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz. Otherwise, you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound.My wah wah, a Morley Power Wah, was almost useless with it. The limited frequency response of the 5\" speaker made it sound overly throaty on cleans and when I put the boost in the shrillness would show itself again.A chorus pedal sounds totally sweet on it, but a phaser, in my case, a Phase 90, just destroys the sound. A flanger is also not really advisable. You can use delay, just not with very rapid repeats. Putting a compressor in front of your clean signal would probably make it more manageable for the Pignose' speaker.

It has a button clip on the back which is non-removable so makes it all but useless if you don't put it on your belt.  I don't know about you but wearing something on my belt with two 1\/4 inch cables is quite a feat.  Add to that possible lines for headphones and an a\/c adapter and you look like OctoMan.And what possible function does the kidney bean shape make other than making it odd to put down anywhere with the belt clip sticking out.  The menu is accessed by using a 4 position finger pad.  The main rotaries on the front have two functions depending whether you are holding another key down to access the second set.

They are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.They don't sound horrible.  I mean, they are not computer speakers or anything.  The sound is very forward, I would say harsh.  That's not uncommon among studio monitors.  There is definitely a lot of clarity here.  Not a ton of bass, but that's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size.  There's a few schools of thought on studio monitors.  Some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music, others think they should sound more like a normal speaker.  These will be more pleasing to people interested in the first.  I definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this.  Any flaws would be quite noticeable.I previously used KRK RP8's so I can compare these to them.  Granted, they are larger and more expensive, although they are also budget monitors.  I liked them better than these.  They were clear but also sounded nicer and, of course, had much more bass.I was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in...see if I could improve the situation...BUT one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it's turned on.  The buzz increases in volume over time.  I tried moving them to a different location, turning the volume down, even disconnecting the audio feed (so they were only plugged into the power).  Nothing stopped the buzz.  If they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds.  So I sent them back.  I wasn't really impressed with the sound and I'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so I'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead.

You can't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible. So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand. If you just gotta buy something from On Stage, get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced.

When you turn both speed controls all the way down to the lowest settings, the bulbs still keep flashing to the next one, about every second.

When you try to adjust the audio flashing, it is so sensitive to sound that the lights just keep flashing very fast in rotation.Also the circuit board inside is held to the metal panel by 4 plastic pegs sticking through the back. They will stick your hand and eventually get pushed inside and the small circuit board will move around.

So why only 3-stars?  This is my fourth strap purchase from Planet Waves.  I have grown to love Planet Waves' straps for their comfort and durability, and obviously the designs.  I thought that this strap was the same as my others only with a different design.  Mainly because at my local music shops, I have never seen\/felt a Planet Waves strap that was NOT made out of their usual thick, soft, and durable material(whatever that might be) that I have grown to love.  This strap is VERY thin and brittle feeling, which makes it very uncomfortable to use.  This strap DOES slide easily on your shirt (which is what I prefer) but once it makes contact with your neck it is SHARP and it makes your neck sore and itchy.  Needless to say this strap is definitely not suited for playing without a shirt on, Ouch!  I have tried running it through the washing machine a few times with fabric softener along with using it constantly to try to get it broken in.  But it is still as sharp as it was out of the package.  Maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up.  That is if it lasts that long.Overall what you need to know is that this strap is NOT the same as the other Planet Waves straps.  The material is very thin and brittle feeling; unlike the many other straps from Planet Waves.  If comfort is not important to you then get this strap.  The price can't be beat and will give your guitar that 70's look.  If I would have paid $20+ on this strap I would be furious.

Peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners. I'd even tried one, once, but decided it wasn't the sort of thing to be carrying around to jams.  So, when I saw that Peterson had introduced a clip on tuner, I couldn't help but salivate.\"Awkward\" is a relative term, but I don't feel it's a disservice to use it here.  The typical clip-on tuner has an LCD \"needle\". When the needle is dead center, the string is tuner.  If it's short of center, the string is flat.  If it's past center, the string is sharp.  The SC-1 has two sets of rings that appear to rotate, analogous to what a strobe might look like.  A string is in tune when the rings stop rotating.  I found that with the way the sound of strings decays, it's difficult to get the rings to stop spinning, even in the SC-1's sustain mode.  (I've already returned the tuner.  Otherwise, I just realized, it would have been a big help to have done a short video of tuning a guitar with the SC-1 and with a Zoid or Intelli.)The SC-1 also boasts a \"sweetened\" mode for tuning guitars.  However, when  I tuned my lounging-at-home guitar this way, I found the needle was dead center on every string on my Intelli tuner. (For those who've read my other reviews, my preferred Zoid was in the case with my favorite guitar.)It may well be, and others may report, that the SC-1's feature set make it ideal for other situations.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B005FKF1PY","helpful":[1,1],"overall":2.0,"reviewText":"Compared to the SnarkSnark SN-1 Tunertuners, I really like the low profile \/ leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. The Snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. This works much better in that regard. This one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine.  Tuning accuracy? Hard to say- it just indicates high \/ low \/ on pitch, really. I prefer the more precise and wider scale +\/1 readout of the Snark. They are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. But this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.The negatives, and why I can't recommend it are as follows. The battery cover on mine fits very loosely. I worry the battery will fall out very easily. I may end up gluing it in place. It isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up I think).  The second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user- that's right, sideways.  On a bass, I don't really need it to tell me which string I'm plucking or tuning, but I still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it. It wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B00646MZHK","helpful":[4,4],"overall":3.0,"reviewText":"Edit: I've had to downgrade my star rating a bit, so I've revised my review- full explanation below, but in short, this just doesn't work as well for me as the SN-1.Background- I have the original SN-1 as well, and have had it for a couple years. The ball socket on the back of the tuning head broke fairly quickly when I forgot to remove it from the headstock before putting it in the gig bag (Protec Contego semi-rigid hybrid case with a little more room around the headstock than your average padded bag). I rigged a repair that has worked OK, but figured a replacement was in order. However other than the broken socket, this has been one of the best tuners I've ever used. Very quick and intuitive. Bright and easy to read in all lighting conditions. Fast response on all strings, including the low B on several five string basses. Despite what I feel is a weakness in the design (the fragile socket), I still felt so good about the functionality of the product that I ordered another, this time the SN-8(B) \"Super Tight\" tuner. I decided to go with another model in the hopes that a newer model might be a little better reinforced at the ball sockets (hence the \"super tight\", perhaps?).Out of the box, the SN-8 is almost identical to the original, save for the obvious color differences. Then clamp appears the same and doesn't seem to have any greater clamping force that I could detect. Turning it on though, the display is quite different. Basically, it is much more \"to the point\". The indicator bars either side of the center pitch (\"in-tune\", dead center) are much wider and fewer, meaning a less granular and less precise display, but one that is very easy to read at a glance in any light. This could be a mixed blessing, but the up side is it is brighter, simpler, and potentially quicker for on the fly tuning. The downside is it is not granular enough to say, intonate an instrument's bridge. It also seems to respond much quicker, which I am realizing is also mixed blessing, and here we have the missing star. The speed also means it responds really quickly to all input, meaning it seems to want to constantly change the note it is sensing. It seems much more twitchy than the sn-1. Unless you are able to mute every other string fully, it will jump between notes frequently. This is also one of my (many) complaints about the Planet Waves Mini-Headstock Tuner too.  I've found that attempting to tune with loud background music or other instruments blasting through a PA will cause my instrument to vibrate at other frequencies - even if I successfully mute all other strings, making tuning with the SN-8 that much more difficult. The differences here between the SN-8 and SN-1 are quite noticeable. For that reason, I just ordered another SN-1.I can't say how this tuner would work for other instruments, as I am a bass player. I'm not sure there is or isn't a defect or flaw here, perhaps it just didn't live up to my expectations (set high by my awesome experience with the original).

The sound from a $40 pedal is outstanding, much better than I ever expected.The Voodoo is a fuzz pedal, meant to give a sort of Jimi Hendrix sound. This pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave. Alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like Hendrix. I was able to hold a note for two minutes with this box, the sustain is big. All was not completely perfect, it might be me and the way I'm adjusting this, but I had a bit of trouble with feedback.From a sound standpoint, this is a great value and does a good job of fuzzing up my sound. Combined with Joyo's California, Hendrix is almost in the house. (Joyo JF-15 Guitar Effect Pedal California Sound True Bypass)I have a Boss ME-70 multi-effect pedal. This Joyo single effect pedal blows away my Boss pedal, I'm almost sad to say that. I don't have experience with other single effect pedals, so I can't make a comparison to those more costly pedals.I have a Marshall Amp and cabinet with 4 x 12 inch speakers. My guitar is a Gibson Les Paul 2008 Standard Plus.From a construction standpoint, these are remarkable for the price point. The whole thing has a good weight. The base has a dense skid resistant foam rubber on it. The box is a solid cast metal box, with a very heavy metal base. The bypass and octave up switches are solid and bolted tightly to the box. The 1\/4 inch input and output jacks are really sweet - there is a metal insert that screws into the plastic internal jack. It looks to me like it would be very hard to break this jack - that outer ring is heavy duty. The pots look really good. For this pedal, they went with press on knobs. If the knob ever breaks, they are a very easy replacement at Radio Shack. The only weak point is the somewhat thin Mid Cut toggle switch. Given that it is between three knobs, I think it would be hard to break this switch - but it is a little lighter weight than I would like.The pedal comes with a 9 Volt battery. It also has a standard 9V power jack on the side, to use an AC adapter or large rechargeable battery pack.This is not a high end pedal, at this price point, nobody should ever expect that. But darn it, this is one amazingly nice pedal when I consider price.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B00E0EXYMS","helpful":[1,3],"overall":3.0,"reviewText":"I received these TASCAM headphones as part of the Amazon Vine review program.  I was excited to receive them, as I've looked at them many times and considered ordering due to the reasonable price point and 'professional grade' designation.I'm not an audiophile, nor am I snob about audio devices.  Any brand that works well at the right price, I'll buy it.  That being said, I've recently been fortunate enough to get to try out lots of headphones, with theBose AE2w Bluetooth Headphones - Blackbeing the most recent.Obviously the Bose beat the TASCAM ones, so it would be unfair to compare them other than to say that 'sound wise' you can really tell a difference in the mid and high range.  These TASCAM TH-2000-R 'Professional Grade' Headphones don't sound clear to me in the mid and high ranges.  Bass is great, but even when tweaking the equalizer settings I never could find the clarity I was seeking in the full range.I listened to several genres: Classical, Blues, Pop, Rock, Electronic, Country, and Latino with these headphones.  Each time, the quality was good, but not great despite attempted software and device adjustments on my iPhone, PC andYamaha RX-V675 7.2 Channel Network 3D AV Receiver with Airplay (Black).The fit of the headphones is big for me.  Usually, they are too small.  Having them as small as I could make them (top of my head to ears), the cups still dropped down a bit lower than I liked. I had to hold them in place to get a solid fit.  The padding underneath the headpiece is minimal, and after about 15 minutes of use the top of my head hurt.The build quality of these phones appears to be excellent. The cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated 6'.  The screw on adapter: 1\/8(3.5mm) to 1\/4(6.3mm) allows for use with multiple devices, stereo components and sound boards.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B00JBIVXGC","helpful":[0,0],"overall":5.0,"reviewText":"I've been thinking about trying the Nanoweb strings for a while, but I was a bit put off by the high price (they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings I've been buying)  and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller. I was intrigued by the promise of long life, though; I have a Taylor Big Baby that I bought used, and which came with a set of Nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year- and they didn't sound at all like old strings. This review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new.I'd just changed the strings on my 1970s Gibson Gospel a week ago, so I decided that would be my reference. The Nanowebs went on my 1970s Guild D-35. Both are well broken in, solid spruce top guitars. The Gospel is a bit brighter sounding, but I'm pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars. If they D-35 sounded dull, I'd notice.As I was unwrapping the Nanowebs I noticed that while they were labeled \"Light\" gauge, they had a 0.013\" E string- something you'd be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings. The B was a .017, compared to the .016 of the D'Addarios I usually play. The rest of the strings were there usual light gauges. Turns out that these are \"HD Light\" gauge, designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end. The difference shouldn't be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so I went ahead and installed them on the D-35.So how do they sound? The unwound E and B don't sound different from any other plain steel string, of course. The E does feel a tiny bit stiffer, when I switch between the D-35 and the Gospel. Sound-wise, I'd say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day. I wouldn't call them dull by any stretch of the imagination. If I didn't know that they were coated strings I certainly wouldn't be able to tell from playing them. So they're good sounding strings, and they last a long time. That leaves the question of cost- are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings?Here's the way I see it: If you're a heavy strummer, or playing gigs every night, maybe not. You're probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they'd go dull from corrosion or contamination. But if you're a finger picker, or a light strummer, a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run. And if you're a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house, and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family, coated strings are probably an excellent choice. For myself, I'm going to leave these on the D-35 for as long as they still sound good. I'll update this review when I find out just how long they do last.Follow up: After playing these for a few days, I actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my Loar LH-350, an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars. They sound great on the Loar, and now I have two guitars to do a long term test on.","reviewTime":"07 2, 2014","reviewerID":"A1RPTVW5VEOSI","reviewerName":"Michael J.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B000T9PE9E","helpful":[11,12],"overall":4.0,"reviewText":"I've never really owned a fuzz pedal before, but have tried a few. Out of most I've tried, I've come across the Big Muff the most. It didn't really strike me as a good flavor of distortion to have until recently. Even my Boss Hyper Metal HM-3 is considered by some to be a fuzz pedal by some folks, but it isn't 100% there, certainly.My budget being what is it right now, I didn't want to spend a lot for a fuzz pedal. There are loads of fuzzes available for $100 or less, but this model is essentially three pedals in one. That's what attracted me to it, along with a few reviews in YouTube. Not to mention the bargain basement price.The three modes can be accessed via a switch on the right side of this pedal. The two fuzz modes (in my view) don't perfectly emulate any one pedal, but are extremely useful nonetheless.FUZZ 1 is a creamy, midrange filled sound. It doesn't get too bright, until the TREBLE knob is pushed past 3 o' clock. This fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick. With humbuckers, it's actually quite clean in silences until the gain is past about 2 o' clock. I love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay. It seems to work best with power chords (root-5th note), and single notes. If you play complex chords, you'll hardly notice them; if you try to play them, use as little gain as possible.FUZZ 2 is more in line with the Big Muff. It has a scooped midrange, which makes things sound dark and sinister. With the increased bass and treble, complex chords work slightly better here. This fuzz also has more sustain than FUZZ 1, so it buzzes longer. This makes it great to use alongside a guitarist that's using a looser sounding high gain tone that isn't necessarily fuzzy. (Head era KoRn comes to mind for me...)The third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile. BOOST. This mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level. It actually distorts a little, but that's only after cranking the EQ and GAIN knobs all the way up. The resulting buzz does sound a bit like a slightly overdriven non-master volume amp (or a master volume's clean channel fully cranked). Still, throughout most of its gain and volume range, BOOST does a good job of staying clean. This would be great for pushing an amp into overdrive, or extending the gain of a heavily distorted sound. It might also be useful for a tiny volume boost for cleaner guitar tones, or just to maintain a stronger signal for a path full of effects.Overall, I like the tones this pedal spits out. I've only had it a few hours, but I love what I'm hearing so far. The build is similar to the other Behringer pedals I have, a NR100 noise reducer, and a TO800, their overdrive that sounds like a Tube Screamer. With this more recent pedal (built on June of 2010), the knobs seem slightly sturdier than before. I'd still not abuse them too much, though. As always, really abusive stompers might want to look elsewhere (or find a way to put the guts inside a custom built tank).You can't go wrong with the bright blue LED, either! Makes it easy to see on a dark stage, along with the dayglo orange pedal color.","reviewTime":"03 21, 2011","reviewerID":"A1CD7IUM2JRPY1","reviewerName":"Alexander V.

After trying to use it I promptly returned it. I do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows.  I have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer.  I tried recording on the H2 using it's line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my Mackie sound board or my stereo receiver.  No matter how I set the levels the recording on the H2 was very distorted.  I played with the record levels and the AGC and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal.  I have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean, good quality sound.  The problem with my H2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal, which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp. Recording from the internal mics seems to work fine.  I have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the Zoom recorders are the only brand where I have found this problem.The H2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings, look for something else.  I exchanged this model for an H4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal, but not as bad as the H2.  I finally ended up getting the Tascam DR-07 which I am very happy with.  It has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder.","reviewTime":"09 4, 2009","reviewerID":"A1T9SCT89JJ96","reviewerName":"David Townsend","summary":"Poor quality recorder","unixReviewTime":1252022400,"full_review":"poor quality recorder i purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price after trying to use it i promptly returned it i do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows i have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer i tried recording on the h using it s line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my mackie sound board or my stereo receiver no matter how i set the levels the recording on the h was very distorted i played with the record levels and the agc and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal i have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean good quality sound the problem with my h was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp recording from the internal mics seems to work fine i have worked with professional sound equipment for over years and the zoom recorders are the only brand where i have found this problem the h has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings look for something else i exchanged this model for an h n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal but not as bad as the h i finally ended up getting the tascam dr which i am very happy with it has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder","label":1},

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B001LJUVO4","helpful":[1,1],"overall":3.0,"reviewText":"I bought one of these a couple of years ago. I used it to connect my Behringer BCR2000 (in MIDI mode, naturally!) to my computer for mixing duties in REAPER. It worked with no issues and I had zero complaints.A few weeks ago it stopped working (I had bent the USB connector and so I thought that was the culprit) so I bought another.The replacement arrived and installed with no issues, but I'm still having trouble getting it to send MIDI data into the computer. MIDI out of the computer to the Behringer is fine. I'm not sure if this is due to the adapter or some funky Windows update that's happened lately, but it's certainly not ideal! :(In my haste, having seen it install OK but without trying to actually use it, I discarded the packaging. Unfortunately the replacement is displaying the same symptoms as the first unit, so now it looks like I'm stuck with two possibly-broken USB \/ MIDI interfaces. I have reinstalled Windows, tried both with another computer, uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, all kinds of good stuff and I still can't get either of them to send MIDI data into the computer. I was v-e-r-y close to throwing my Behringer unit away as I thought it was broken too!Thankfully I tried an old Yamaha interface and it is OK. This means I just need to get and buy some MIDI cables and I'll be back in business.So, I'd say buy one of these, and make sure it works before you throw your packaging away! When they work they're absolutely great and they're SO cheap! If you receive a lemon, return it and order another. It's worth it if you're not in a hurry. If you *are* in  a hurry then order a few of them, or just get something else.I'd also like to advise people that reports of MIDI latency with these devices is quite probably a misnomer. I strongly suspect that the speed of transferring MIDI data into your computer through this device is much faster than you think, and the actual latency you're experiencing is that of converting your MIDI data into audio. This happens inside your computer and has **nothing** to do with this device's performance; it's purely down to your hardware and software configurations. All this talk of ASIO is only really going to help you on the audio side of things. If you're using this device to record MIDI data then you should have no issues at all... as long as you get one that works! :-)Cheers.","reviewTime":"12 15, 2012","reviewerID":"A3ABAA36CZVYNX","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"cheap 'n' cheerful... ish... and watch your \"latency\"","unixReviewTime":1355529600,"full_review":"cheap n cheerful ish and watch your latency i bought one of these a couple of years ago i used it to connect my behringer bcr in midi mode naturally to my computer for mixing duties in reaper it worked with no issues and i had zero complaints a few weeks ago it stopped working i had bent the usb connector and so i thought that was the culprit so i bought another the replacement arrived and installed with no issues but i m still having trouble getting it to send midi data into the computer midi out of the computer to the behringer is fine i m not sure if this is due to the adapter or some funky windows update that s happened lately but it s certainly not ideal in my haste having seen it install ok but without trying to actually use it i discarded the packaging unfortunately the replacement is displaying the same symptoms as the first unit so now it looks like i m stuck with two possibly broken usb midi interfaces i have reinstalled windows tried both with another computer uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers all kinds of good stuff and i still can t get either of them to send midi data into the computer i was v e r y close to throwing my behringer unit away as i thought it was broken too thankfully i tried an old yamaha interface and it is ok this means i just need to get and buy some midi cables and i ll be back in business so i d say buy one of these and make sure it works before you throw your packaging away when they work they re absolutely great and they re so cheap if you receive a lemon return it and order another it s worth it if you re not in a hurry if you are in a hurry then order a few of them or just get something else i d also like to advise people that reports of midi latency with these devices is quite probably a misnomer i strongly suspect that the speed of transferring midi data into your computer through this device is much faster than you think and the actual latency you re experiencing is that of converting your midi data into audio this happens inside your computer and has nothing to do with this device s performance it s purely down to your hardware and software configurations all this talk of asio is only really going to help you on the audio side of things if you re using this device to record midi data then you should have no issues at all as long as you get one that works cheers","label":2},

I went to the large Guitar store and tried out several in this price range and couple hundred above and settled on this one because of the sweet sound and workmanship.  For the money I don't think it can be beat.  Mahogany not plywood sides and back and Cedar top make for a really nice mellow tone and a bone nut and saddle thrown in for good measure.  Bone does make a considerable difference I have found.  All the finish is excellent.  Now for some down sides.  Yes the frets were not finished up to par on the ends.  As for leveling it seemed OK.  So I took some time and masked off the fret board and finished the frets flush with the fingerboard and rounded the sides and tops.  Cedar will scratch and nick just looking at it.  You can make your own clear plastic pick guards to any size by going to Wal Mart and in the material sewing department you will find clear plastic in large rolls.  You can buy a half yard long x 54\" and make enough pick guards to last a life time for a couple bucks.  It clings to the gloss finish nicely. (Do not use this on old guitars with Nitro finish it will eat the finish instantly)  Same goes when changing strings.  Put some masking tape at the end of the bridge on the top to prevent the strings from scratching the Cedar top.  Overall like one reviewer said this guitar is hard to put down.  I put a Baggs I-Beam pickup in it also.  Easy installation and nice natural sound.

Basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out.  I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon.  Nope.  Even the pop filter fell off.  I LOVE the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage... ex:  adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc.  Otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option.  Just make it one solid piece.  I'm tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design.  It's just not strong enough.  Not that it's a surprise though.

First, in the setup screen do NOT enable the FBV Express. Yes, I know this sounds dumb, but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for...2. Read the FBV Express users guide and calibrate the pedal.. there is no need to d\/l the FBV software for this.Now.. In the POD setup screens you have the option to either have the ABCD buttons as ABCD, or to be FS5-FS8. This behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the FBV.So.. In ABCD mode you can:a) Select preset A, B, C or D from the group you are currently in.b) Insert a volume FX and use volume pedal...EXP2c) Insert another FX enabled by toe switch, and controlled by pedal as EXP1d) tap temp (by tapping the currently selected preset..ie the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press\/hold the current selected preset pedal)f) you have some basic control of the looper, but CANNOT enable it.3\/10\/14 EDIT :Looper control is flawed. You can record and go to overdub, but you cannot record then play\/stop the loop.. you can stop from overdub but not start the loop. seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugNice enough, but if you are like me, switching presets is way way less useful than switching FX blocks on & off. incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns OD on, and delay & chorus both off, or turn one amp on and one off (channel switching)..

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B0042EZH6W","helpful":[1,1],"overall":5.0,"reviewText":"I got one of these here on Amazon as a replacement for my other small practice amp, an older Fender 25 watt blackface two-channel that didn't have integrated EFX (that one has been more or less permanantly allocated to my church).Great little amp. Only had it for a couple days, but the sounds you can evoke out of this thing are amazing. Clean tones are pristine. Distortion tones, a bit on the transistory side, but again, I haven't played with the setting enough (or even tried all the emulations). Controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on. It is a bit lacking in low-end, to be expected from a small 8\" speaker. But that is okay for practice and rehearsal. It is loud enough for rehearsal with a drummer (depending on the style of music). I did purchase the single button footswitch as well and it works great at switching between any TWO settings you define.Have not had a chance to mess with the included software, but intend to do that when I have time. I like the fact that I can tweak the amp to my EXACT preferences and it stays in memory; I only really have to do it once. Great feature.Only suggestions to Fender would be to add a recessed area in the back to stow the power cord (standard computer type) and optionally, the included USB cable.Overall, for the price, it is an incredible value. Great alternative to lugging my full rig (Marshall 2X12 cab, racked Rocktron Pirhanna, ADA 100 watt tube head, Alesis Midiverb IV and some other stuff). Get yours while you can at this price.UPDATE -- The Fender software that you can download and use with this amp is freaking amazing. I now have it more or less permanently attached to my computer via USB and am constantly tweaking and refining my tones. The Princeton amp emulation is SWEET. I am going to buy a second one, probably the larger Mustang III, cause I want the larger Celestion speaker. You know, pretty much every Fender product I have ever purchased has been first rate, and this amp is no exception.

The Snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. This works much better in that regard. This one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine.  Tuning accuracy? Hard to say- it just indicates high \/ low \/ on pitch, really. I prefer the more precise and wider scale +\/1 readout of the Snark. They are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. But this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.The negatives, and why I can't recommend it are as follows. The battery cover on mine fits very loosely. I worry the battery will fall out very easily. I may end up gluing it in place. It isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up I think).  The second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user- that's right, sideways.  On a bass, I don't really need it to tell me which string I'm plucking or tuning, but I still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it. It wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow.

{"_corrupt_record":null,"asin":"B00646MZHK","helpful":[24,25],"overall":4.0,"reviewText":"I will keep my review short as there have been MANY factual and well written reviews for the various Snark tuners over the years.  Quickly though, I will start by also agreeing that for the price, it is hard to beat.  This is mostly why I have given it 4 stars and just bought a sixth one.  It is accurate, reliable for tuning, and affordable.  All that said, here is why I decided to write a review.  I have owned about 5 of these Snarks and every single one has broken after about 3-4 months use.  The unit itself is great.  Here is the problem.  Where the tuner attaches to the guitar and where the tuner attaches itself to it's own clip is where this little gem falls short.  Sure, if you put it on a guitar and leave it there at home, it will likely last at least a year and maybe longer requiring a battery change one day if you are lucky.  However, if you travel with it, take it on or off a few guitars a day, or frequently adjust it, it will likely eventually break.  Either the \"rubber feet\" that come into contact with the head stock of the guitar will come off and get lost or the little ball joint that connects the tuner's head to the clip part will break.  Best to get several of these at this great price and just keep one on each of your guitars.  One for the electric, one for the acoustic, etc.  This item does not travel well and is best used at home gently.","reviewTime":"10 4, 2012","reviewerID":"A342XAA3YXGKT9","reviewerName":"J.
