{"reviewerID": "AH2F47XZ5L8NR", "asin": "B000T517Y4", "reviewerName": "Violet Deliriums", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "I own several Electro-Harmonix pedals and overall I like the brand (even though the owner appears to me to be a sexist pig clown boy in many of his YouTube videos). Of those I own, two of them are the smaller versions of the GIGANTOR classic E-H pedals, one of them being the Little Big Muff.First of all, if you have no idea of the difference between fuzz, overdrive, and distortion you should look into it before you buy anything. These effects are used in different musical styles and produce different sounds, so your choice will depend on what exactly you plan to do. Do some research by looking on YouTube, looking at Dave Hunter's book on effects, and testing them out at a store.If you are looking for a basic fuzz box, the Little Big Muff will give you nice sound similar to (if not the same) as that of the Big Muff Pi, depending on the exact year/model you have. I think the tone is great, but as with most basic fuzz boxes, there are only so many different sounds that you can get out of them. It is simple to use though, and it makes a lot of noise.As a bonus, these don't take up a lot of pedalboard space compared to the Big Muff Pi, yet will give the same tone. It is great for punk, alt rock/grunge, and classic hard rock like Hendrix and Black Sabbath.I also have a germanium (red) Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini, another good small version of one of the classics, and the Fuzz Face mini that gives you the most low end emphasis of the three (the blue silicon and aqua Hendrix models boost treble more). To quickly compare it to the Little Big Muff regarding sound, the Fuzz Face does not have a tone control, but I think it gives a better control over the fuzz saturation. While the Little Big Muff will give you more control over the tone (EQ), like many EHX pedals it goes from zero to crazy rather quickly. In this case when you begin turning the Sustain, it is not long before you are in very fuzz saturated zone. As you increase the amount of saturation, you get more sustain but less control of the dynamics so all your pick attacks begin to sound the same. So, I'd say while both the red Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini & the Little Big Muff are good tools, each comes with its own disadvantages.Though some E-H units come with power supply, this one does not and you will need to get one unless you like changing batteries. Although few pedals come with power supplies, I think its lame not to include them and you will need to factor it into the cost of the unit.If you are into looking at pretty pedals on your board, then you might be able to find a prettier fuzz box than the stark and dreary industrial-looking Little Big Muff. I like pretty things, but the sound of this unit is too good to pass up and it is a great tool to have in your kit.Bottom line:(1) Gives the classic Big Muff fuzz sound(2) Does not eat up pedalboard space like the old GIGANTOR models(3) Noisy (not always in a good way) when on, but has true bypass when off(4) Has tone control (EQ), but the \"Sustain\" saturates very quickly so you get less fuzz control (limits dynamic control of your picking)(4) Simple to use, but limited sound palette(5) Decent price, but power supply sold separately(6) Bleak appearance (not shiny, colorful, or sparkly)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Classic fuzz, compact size", "unixReviewTime": 1358985600, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2013"},

A few of my notes:- This pick is very slightly bigger than the Jazz iiis i linked above. I like this a lot. The tip is almost exactly the same size, but the top grip area is ever so slightly bigger. Still, these picks are significantly smaller than your \"average\" size pick.- The rubber grip area is a joy to hold. Very comfortable, very stable, lots of grip- If you didn't know, Dava picks dont come in varying thickness. They are instead \"control\" picks. Meaning depending on where you grip the pick it will become more or less rigid. Look at the picture --- see those three horizontal lines in the middle of the pick? Those are reference markers --- choke up on the pick (lowest line near the tip) for leads and pull back for more flexible strumming. This will take me some time to get used to but it is pretty nice in theory. However, even choking up on the pick, it is not as rigid as the jazz iiis and sometimes for fast work I was wishing I was still holding the jazz iii.- These Dava Jazz come in three colors: Red (Delrin material), Yellow (Nylon material), Orange (Gel). Different materials produce different sounds/feels.

This may be too tall for some (with the mic put in, it stands as tall as my 17&#34; ASUS G75VW) but I have a raised desk so this fits right up to my mouth.2. The Snowball screws right in (unscrew the holder thing that comes on there, screw the snowball in, win).3. After some research, I found that this will fit pretty much any mic. Cool.4. It seems sturdy and well built.Cons1. The legs make this thing very, very wide. It's about 2/3 the size of my keyboard which means it takes up a lot of space.2. The mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird. Not bad, just weird.Overall, this is highly recommended for a desk stand.

The H4n is a great versatile field recorder. I mainly use it to record audio for live event video such as weddings and speaking engagements. The H4n is a work horse. It has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats. I highly recommend purchasing a \"furry head\" wind screen for the unit as the foam wind screen included is not for out door use.Unlike the H1 design that has a hard protective ring around the microphones, the H4n leaves the microphones exposed in order to capture the purest sound possible in live and studio applications. However, be aware that because of the exposed microphone design the external mics are prone to breaking off if the unit is dropped. I had this happen once. If this happens to you, don't worry. I searched the internet and was able to find several Zoom certified service centers within my general area. I called the closest service center, spoke with a repairman and shipped the H4n off and the mic was replaced under warranty; I didn't pay a dime. I had it shipped off and back in 7 days.All in all the H4n is a great field recorder. I mainly use it in 4 channel mode. 4 Chanel mode allows me to record from both external microphones as well as the two XLR inputs at the same time. In some cases I also use a small 4 Channel Behringer field mixer if I have to run more than 2 lavalier microphones. Running straight from the mixer outputs to the H4n works perfectly.I do suggest some accessories when using the H4n. As I said earlier, purchase a \"furry head\" wind screen. I use the furry head wind screens every time I record outdoors and they completely eliminate wind noise. I only use 32gb Sandisk SD cards because Sandisk is dependable, I have never ever had one fail in all my years of recording. I record at 48K @ 16bits in .wav format which tends to create a lot of data when at live events so 32gbs is large enough to record over 20hours at that sampling rate. This allows me to keep old audio clips on the card for a while after recording them and is a safety net in case I forget to transfer the audio files along with video when I edit. I also suggest having a DI box on hand in the event you may have to run a line out from someone else's mixer. I have had issues with digital clipping and over saturated sound when running a feed without a DI Box from venue mixers. This has to do with a balance and padding that I am just not going to get into but trust me, a DI box is the simplest and surest fix for these issues. I also suggest getting a small portable mixer in case you have to run more than 2 microphones when at live events. Always be prepared. I use rechargeable Duracell AA batteries and I have never had any issues. Battery life is between 6-8 hours when the unit is left on, and 3-4 hours when left powered on and recording.I do not regret this purchase at all. The H4n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable. I highly recommend purchasing one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great field recorder", "unixReviewTime": 1368403200, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2013"},

I'd been looking a Taylors, but didn't want to spend that much money.Enter the Seagull S6.  A fellow picker asked if I'd ever heard of a Seagull - I hadn't - he said they were nice guitars and I ought to check them out.  So, I did a little research.  I first read all the nice reviews here for the S6 and then went on YouTube and listened to a few.  My guitar is a Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 and I really like it. I choose not to get the cedar top version because the cedar is soft, and I understand that the spruce has more volume. I got the S6 today and this evening my wife, with her Taylor GS Mini, and I, with this S6, played Smokey Mountain Memories.  Nice, real nice guitar.I found that the action on this S6 is pretty good out of the box.  I'm going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pin/peg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time, if he can make the action better, I'll let him.  I'm also going to put on some Elixir Light strings.  I don't know what kind of strings are on it out of the box.But, the bottom line is that I am very happy with the playablilty and the action of this Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 acoustic guitar right out of the box.

This tube modeler acts first as a pre-amp, and then adds gain, volume control, \"crunch\", whatever, to the non-guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps. I don't really care what tube amps it models, or what mic placement, I just want the guitar amp sound and style. I also use it in front of a Behringer Ultra-G DI box, so that the DI box splits the signal coming from the TM300 and sends half to my non-guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage, and the other half to the house PA. I don't think that many people would do this.The sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp, and kind of amp you are driving with it, and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving. The acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound, but I've used this box with all of its settings driving PA amps, home stereo amps, bass amps, and guitar amps, all of which drove PA speakers, bass speakers and Eminence Commonwealth 12 guitar speakers, all in the same acoustic space. Each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant, sound different: some more like guitar  amps and speakers, some not. As I said, I don't really care about what tube amp is being modeled, only that I get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box. It works for me.I read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog Sansamp GT2, and based on its performance so far, it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the Sansamp can do.

The PP400 Ultra-Compact Phono Preamp is exactly what it looks like:It's ultra-compact. It takes up a very negligible amount of space. It will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component.In its compactness, though, it does NOT sacrifice usability. It has no trouble amplifying a turntable's signal to line level. Before buying a preamp, amp could only boost my turntable to a 'easy listening' level. The noise was evident in the signal due to far too much amplification being necessary. With the help of this preamp, my amp no longer acts as a crutch and I can comfortably listen to music without my amp's 'I'm turned up to 11 and struggling' noise.The build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point. It's not cheap plastic like many companies would try to sell, the entire enclosure is fairly thick metal. This makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look. It also features a ground terminal which will hook up to many turntables and amps to further reduce interference.Unfortunately, there is no option to buy it in black. Judging from the accessible screws on the side, though, it would be a small task to take apart the enclosure and paint it myself if I wanted.This preamp also does not have a power switch, but this is not much of an issue.

I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones, with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune. Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability. What I received was the polar opposite: I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish, and one that stays in tune (amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it.)I am not wild about the strings that came stock, but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums. I guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads. In the near future I intend to restring the guitar withD'Addario ECG25 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Light, 12-52, which, while thick, should make the instrument jazz-friendly. I realize that flatwound strings will require a new set-up and intonation, but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me, the new strings and work will be an investment.Out of the box, though, the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [to my novice eyes and fingers] to be properly dressed. I have already invested in a good - but not great case:Guardian Hardshell Electric Guitar Caseto store the guitar (I also uploaded a customer-provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits.)For the record, I use the following amp, which I have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar:Kustom Defender 15 Watt Class A Guitar Headthat I run through aKustom  The Defender 1 x 12 Guitar Extension Cabinet for 5H Head.Bottom line: this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players.

Don't recall if I purchased it on Amazon. In any event, a $30-$50 trip to the luthier with new strings, and it felt like a guitar far in excess of $100. It has stayed in tune quite nicely, and I often change tunings (standard, mostly Eb, occasional full step down, Open D, G and others).No fret buzz, and I just love the feel of the neck. I do wish the body was a tad thinner as I have shoulder problems, but I'm sure a thinner body or shallow bowl would sacrifice bass and richness.

The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin. That is, the Beta 58A, in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it, has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues. For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or, really, any) notes the Beta is a dream. This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or \"popping\" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it.While I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon, I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment. Quite honestly, I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations. The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin, the SM58, but it is worth every penny.

I said all that b/c I don't want to come off as condescending. I've learned that the single most effective way to power pedals properly is to have an infinite number of 9v batteries, or to be very careful to match pedal inputs with correct adaptor outputs. Check the polarity of the tip - is the tip positive or negative? You'll fry a Boss pedal in a flash if you plug a hot positive tip into one. Make sure the polarity matches (most pedals want negative tip adaptors, except Digitech which want 1/8\" plugs). Make sure the voltage matches. A 3v adaptor into a 9v pedal won't power it. Checking that these things are right will save you some $, and some of the Behringer pedals (I use about six of them on my board...see product links) are \"polarity fragile\", and will break right away with the wrong adaptor.

Your mileage may vary on that, but I decided it was time to check out a wider strap that was actually intended for a bass.I read a lot of reviews and decided on this one -- some of the cheaper leather straps were described as stiff and uncomfortable, but this one was usually reviewed well. It was the perfect choice. This strap needs no wearing-in -- it's supple and soft right out of the box. The leather on top is smooth and classy looking, and the suede underneath is comfortable and soft, with good friction that helps it stay put on your shoulder. The wider strap distributes the weight of a bass better, and there is some cushioning between the two layers of leather that also helps. All of this adds up to a great deal of comfort.I use Dunlop strap locks on my instruments, and with a thicker strap like this, I had some concerns about getting them on there, but with a flat head screwdriver and a little bit of encouragement you can put strap locks on this strap, no problem.I would highly recommend this strap for any bass player, or even someone with an especially heavy guitar.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is the comfy reclining chair of straps", "unixReviewTime": 1362960000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2013"},

The amp I have now is a totally bad ass Fryette Deliverance 120, but sadly it has no effects loop. So I thought I was out of luck as far as a BBE goes, because as far as I knew they were only available in rack mount units that could not be placed anywhere but in the effects loop. Then I was looking for pedals on Amazon and, lo and behold, there was a BBE Sonic Maximizer pedal! I snatched it up with a quickness and I am very pleased that it sounds just as good as the rack version. One caveat- if your signal is noisy the BBE can actually increase your signal noise. For this reason I highly recommend using top quality patch and instrument cables and doing all you can to clean up any noisy aspects of your sound before you use it. This pedal is very subtle, but to an audiophile like me it is absolutely essential. It also works great for ANY instrument or sound system. It's also great for vocals as well. But you may want the rack version for those applications. I would also buy the rack version if I had an effects loop to run it through. IMO, the pedal is really only for those folks who have no effects loop but still like what the BBE does. I'd go with the rack just for ease of use and keeping it in the proper place in the signal chain. Plus you can get a stereo rack version and have two BBE's for not much more money that you can use for another application.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just like the rack mount", "unixReviewTime": 1371513600, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2013"},

It looks, feels and plays like an instrument that cost at least twice as much.A few notes: what looks in the product photos like a black finish around the edges and on the back and sides of the &#34;Vintage&#34; model is actually a super-rich deep, deep mahogany/maroon color, and it's unbelievably beautiful.As others have said, the factory-supplied strings are crap; if you judge the instrument by them, you'll be disappointed. Include a set of Aqila Nylgut strings when you order this ukulele, and restring it as soon as you get it.I was a little surprised that the sound was quieter than my $60 Kala soprano uke--normally, one expects a concert ukulele to have a louder, fuller sound. But the Les Paul has a relatively small soundbox compared to an all-acoustic ukulele, and that probably accounts for the quieter tone. I think it's a *better* tone, and I'm more interested in delicacy than in loudness, so I'm happy with it. If I wanted stadium-filling volume, I could always plug this into a stack of Marshall amps.Oh, I almost forgot one important note to all owners: IT IS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE STUPID, UGLY PICK GUARD! Since ukulele players rarely use picks, and when we do, we use soft rubber or felt ones, there's no need to protect the finish from scratching, and that white pick guard really detracts from the instrument's looks.I applied gentle heat from a hair dryer on its low power setting for about ten minutes, and very slowly and gently pried up the edges of the pick guard with my fingernails--no sharp tools! It came off pretty cleanly, leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue. I was able to get rid of those with small amounts of rubbing alcohol on cotton, without any damage to the luscious ultra-glossy lacquer finish. And the ukulele looks SO much better now!

Reverb sounds natural and there is a wide range of choices for both reverb and echo. For the record I keep mine set at Club with the wet/dry knob set to a straight 12 o'clock position. Wet means more of the effect and dry means less.There is a mic gain on the left side of the unit, and the mic input (XLR only) has phantom power. The XLR out goes straight to your mixer. There is also a USB port for software I do not use so I cannot speak to that feature.The unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature, which I leave on. It adds a dimension to vocals that does not interfere with them, not does it alter them in ways that are mechanical sounding - you can set it for minor to major pitch correction. I suspect that most folks will want less of this than more.Overall this is a perfect addition to a vocalist's toolbox because it is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive.

Oh, and one thing I'm a bit iffy about is Spectraflex's lifetime warranty.

I think these and the Dano Cool Cat line are some of the best bang for your buck in pedals these days.  Like many have mentioned, this pedal is like a TS but without the mid-hump.  This pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture.  When you run it into a cleanish tube amp and you dig it, it breaks up.  When you play lightly, it gets cleaner- which is why it is so similar to the $200 Sweet Honey pedal (the controls are also identical but I haven't compared the internals).  That touch sensitivity is lost IMHO if you stack this with another dirt box or if you are running it into an amp that is already raging with gain.  When you do that, it acts more like a traditional OD would- which is totally cool, but you are losing the touch sensitivity thing that sets this pedal apart.  If I could only bring one dirt box to the gig it would probably be something more mid-gain (like the Joyo Ultimate Drive or the Dano Transparent OD)  but if you are in the market for a sweet honey pedal and don't have that kind of bankroll, you should definately check this out-Edit:  Having owned this pedal for a while, I realize I was incorrect in saying you lose touch sensitivity running into another dirtbox.  This pedal actually plays well with mid-gain types of overdrives like the Joyo Ultimate Drive, the OCD, or the Dano Drive.  When you dig in, you CAN get more breakup so long as the other overdrive isn't dimed.

I am not sure if some of the cables others have reviewed have had loose wiring in them, but the cable I received is perfect.I plugged the cable into my Windows laptop, waited 30 seconds while it recognized the cable and installed drivers, and I was good to go. I plugged in a dynamic microphone, opened the Audacity software program, hit record and it was amazing sound quality. I had previously used a variety of input devices from a JamHub to a Behringer USB line input device to an Art audio preamp to even going low-budget with just a cable directly into the microphone input of the (ThinkPad) laptop. This cable provides as high quality of an audio signal as any other reasonably priced device I have used.There are, however, a few limitations...- This cable is mono only, i.e. not for stereo recording. This seems obvious, but is worth mentioning for those who have less experience with this type of stuff.- This cable only works with Dynamic Microphones. If your microphone is a Condenser microphone, you either need a battery powered microphone or some type of 'phantom' power source to power the condenser microphone.The really good things?- This cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the Audacity software. Some input devices are either very hot (too much level) or have hardly any gain at all, so this cable works very well by providing just the right level.- This cable works amazingly well with a direct box to record a bass guitar, acoustic/electric guitar, keyboard, etc. I have a lot of direct boxes and this works well on all of them.

If abused, trying to cut copper wire, it might break; but the tool was never designed for that use.I've used this tool now for several months and expect that it will last for a very long time.

Instead of writing a separate review for each, I figured I&#8217;d write one review for both types of strings and post it in both places for those who are trying to figure out which strings would best meet their needs.The Phosphor Bronze strings are mounted on a brand new Guild F-47 RC guitar. It is a concert sized guitar with a Florentine cutaway. The body is Brazilian Rosewood and the top is Adirondack (Red) Spruce. I have always heard that Phosphor is a bit brighter and sounds better on a Rosewood guitar. I would agree. The tone is nicely balanced &#8211; maybe a bit weak in the bass, but the strings are new and in a couple days I expect them to sound a bit better.  The notes are articulated well, and there is a nice midrange tone.The Nanoweb coating is nice. It protects the strings from corrosion (finger sweat really can do a job on strings) without dulling the sound. I think the guitar sounds much better than it did with the original (Guild) strings, and it just plays easier.The 80/20 strings are mounted on a Gibson Hummingbird &#8211; an iconic Mahogany body/Spruce-topped Dreadnaught sized guitar. Again, 80/20s are recommended for Mahogany guitars. As popular as the Hummingbird is, I was never totally pleased with the sound of it.  It is a great guitar to strum along with while singing, but it almost sounded too muddied &#8211; not enough articulation between the different strings. The Elixir strings really bring out something extra from the Gibson. It sounds a LOT better and feels easier to play. The strings are easier to play &#8211; partially because of the coating &#8211; partially because the metal used in the string seems to have a bit more elasticity &#8211; without going out of tune.The bass is tighter and there is an even spread of tone from the lowest to the highest notes. I am very happy with how much better this guitar sounds with these strings compared to the Martin SPs that were on it prior to the switch.Elixirs are not the cheapest strings out there, but since they last a lot longer than cheaper strings, in the end you won&#8217;t spend more money on what I think are far superior strings.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sounding and playing strings!", "unixReviewTime": 1405728000, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2014"},

Aside from that, it also does nearly every other type of delay needed:*the tape/digital/analog switch slightly changes the sound of each delay*the trails feature can be useful for holding a sound (in swell mode with high repeats) when the pedal is &#34;off&#34; and then playing over it with notes or harmony*the time knob acts like an analog knob, pitch shifting when turned after playing a note*the repeats knob can go from a little more than one repeat to self oscillation (sometimes runaway) depending on the delay type*the mix knob can nearly cut out the dry signal*stereo input allows for multiple instruments to play into itWhile the pedal has small problems, it compensates by inexpensive fixesCons:The modulation is a kind of adjustable width/depth all in one knob, and isn't the best compared to a chorus pedal. Just a general warbleThe blue led is VERY bright, to the point where you can't see the settings on the knobs, so I cover it with a sticker (it still shows through enough haha)*The casing is plastic, but it is thick and durable enough (maybe not for consistent gigging)*being a digital effect, the footswitch is not state dependent, in other words, if you turn off the pedal, unplug it, and plug it back in, the pedal will turn on*because it is buffered bypass, the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it, even when off*the battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch, and then lift up*there is no noticeable &#34;click&#34; when you change delay type; however, the led flashesOther notes:almost half the weight of the pedal is the bottom metal plate.

Sure, there are plenty of other options out there, but I just had it in my head thats what I wanted. Well, I must say I am very happy with the purchase. Guitar arrived in its triangular shelf box, inside another Dean shipping box, which was wrapped in bubble sheet packed inside yet another, larger, Amazon box. Was essentially ready to play right out of the box, with a few quick turns of the tuning pegs. One knock on it I have seen online before buying was that the tuners don't hold tight, I have not yet had this problem after a week of playing it, including some drastic bends. Checked with a steel straightedge and a light, the neck was dead flat and straight. The edges of the frets could use some more finishing, they are still a bit edgy. I have seen others mention filing them down a bit, same thing that would be done on a more expensive guitar at the factory. I will probably get some diamond files and do this as well, I keep hanging up my hand on them on the bottom of the neck. I'm no expert on tone, but this has a nice even sound and responds well to pretty much any pedals or effects I've thrown at it. I did restring mine with the DR Neon Multi-Color strings for using with Rocksmith, which required adjusting the intonation. The low E and A strings ended up at the very end of their range, and the A is actually still a tiny bit flat. This could well be a factor of those particular strings though, so I wont knock the guitar for it. As others have noted, the finish can vary drastically. Mine is much darker than the stock photo and the grain is much less noticeable. Overall, looks a nice piece, especially for the cost. I could not ask for better for this price. From what I hear from more experienced players, as I progress I could easily upgrade the tuners and pickups, though I think I will leave this one alone and just get a higher end guitar when its time.OVERALL:Nice looking, feeling guitar for a beginner.PROS:Excellent value.Good quality construction.Feels and looks good right out of the box.Can be upgraded in time if you choose.CONS:Tuners may or may not slip when playing hard.Finish is variable, be willing to accept whatever shade you get.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Only my first guitar, but I absolutely love it.", "unixReviewTime": 1393459200, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2014"},

Saw this in TV yellow and had to have it. I came well packed and looked much better in person than the pics on the website. It was set-up very well, among the few guitars I have purchased that were playable out of the box. Fret work is top notch. Finish is good, some very slight blems but if you play it like you should you'll add some of your own. There was a slight binding in the nut, most people think it's the tuners right away but most tuning problems are at the nut. A quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up. If you can't make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech. When you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue. The only thing I did was lower the bridge a bit and this thing plays like a dream. Plugged in it sounds good, you can get a lot of different sounds with the simple use of the volume and tone. Picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound. Play close to the bridge with tone wide open puts you in Tele territory while using the volume to clean things up or add some dirt to the sound. Add some tone knob and pick closer to the neck to get into the blues region. This guitar will make you a more versatile player. The absence of a neck pickup reduces the magnetic pull on the strings and lets them ring out. Sustain is very good as a result. I could carry on forever but you get the idea. I've been a player for 45 years and a collector for half of that. I own many vintage guitars including Gibson, Fender, Gretsch. I have the most pleasure from playing the newer imports, the quality is superb on the most recent ones.

At first it was kind of weird since the strap grips your shirt a little bit and wrinkles it up if you try to move it around. But after a while I found it a quite useful feature of this strap because your guitar wont slide around when you're playing and will stay nice and steady while playing. Those with neck heavy guitars might also want to give this a shot since it grips so well. It is also very long, longer than i thought. I have it slung a little low, and there's plenty of slack left on the strap. So it's probably long enough for Shaq to use it and still sling it as low as James Hetfield.  The only complaint I have about this guitar is the fact that it was a little tough to get on my epiphone les paul. But again it adds another feature to the strap, since the thing isn't falling off anytime soon! I almost feel like I wont even need strap locks it's so good.

I work at a church as a pastor of Worship Arts and use this in my work. But I hesitate to say I'm only \"pro\", because \"amateur\" means you do something purely for the love of it... and I feel that way about music... So...First... the models I've tested are far and away more realistic to my ears than other modelers I've used, which includes Logic Studio's amps (these sound almost as good btw), POD X3Live and XTPro (the HD models are noticeably better... and the fizz is GONE GONE GONE), the original POD and 2.0 (which sounded the same to me and made me happy at the time), and the ToneLab SE (which I missed for a while, but not anymore).I made a few patches for one of my guitars based on having a Bassman 4x10 alongside the Dr. Z, and it is the coolest sound I've ever made with this guitar... easily. Better sounding, to my ears, than the real amps I've been using (maybe because I put them off stage and don't run them very loud). I ADORE the sound of this unit.Oh, and as always... forget about all the pre-sets. They're probably all as useless as you imagine they might be.Now the bad news. And it's significant... for some...First off, editing is clunky like it was on the XT and X3Live. Just forget about trying to use the display. Connect to a computer... Seriously. When you start from an init patch, you only get lucky, it seems, to manage to coax it into \"two amp\" config...Next, The functionality of this unit is exaggerated by it's specs. You will almost certainly NOT be able to do 8 FX at once the way you're thinking. Why? Let's say you use an XT or a X3. think about what you're used to.You start with 8 FXSubtract effect banks for...1. volume pedal (you need to use an effect bank). You might be able to use an analog pedal, but I like my volume after my compressor... so I have to do it in the loop I guess...2. FX loop (only works with an effect bank... Line6, is there any way you can make this always active in a firmware upgrade? Seems like you could.)3. Noise Gate (used to be always available... don't worry if you mix this with the M13 as I plan to do, though, as the M13 has a great gate). I mostly use clean or just barely broken-up amps, so I might be able to skip this.4. Wah (this is always available and active in the X3 and below).5. Post-EQ. The X3Live had a final EQ before final output that I liked a lot. in addition to all the other FX, too. You need to dedicate an FX bank now.SO... you might only have 3FX left. For me, put in a clean boost and tube drive (which I think sound better in this box than they did in the M13. Probably because they're \"digitally part of the signal\" is all I can think) and a verb for the amp. No slots left. What if you need delay and modulation? EEK! I have to re-think the way I use FX in this box. Still evaluating how that will work for me.What if you're a guy like me who was using the X3Live (occasionally) as a one-box solution for a dual-voice guitar. (All my guitars have piezo bridges.) No dice.I will have to use an acoustic preamp. No matter. I have one. I will probably dedicate a \"null\" amp to bring this signal into the unit and mix it.In addition, there aren't as many computer-recording routing options as the X3Live, and the SUPER-sweet ability to switch between two FX chains in one patch (instead of switching programs) is gone. As far back as my old Vox ToneLab SE, I could literally switch channels from one amp/cab to another in the same FX chain. You could do something similar on the X3Live. Not here. Also... Line 6, why on earth can't you make the Midi in and out work as a USB Midi interface with this unit? How complicated can that really be?In short... the X3Live has significantly... SIGNIFICANTLY more flexibility imho than this unit, for many of us at least, and ought not to have been discontinued imho. For some of you, it's still a viable option.You also still might need your other FX!I thought it might be possible that this unit, even if I needed to use my AG Stomp for my acoustic side again (which I'm happy to do) would bump my M13 off the stage. It did not at first, but after a while, I did indeed get rid of the M13, and don't miss it.. That said, I think from what I'm hearing that some of the FX (especially the dirt pedals) work FAR better inside this box than they do in the M13 when you connect it to a POD or amp.My favorite patches so far that I've made (which use the Bassman model and the UNBELIEVABLE Dr. Z model... far and AWAY my favorite amp model EVAH!) don't leave any room for modulation or other special FX. (I'm not a \"switch whole patches on the fly\" guy. I turn FX off and on.) But after a bit of tweaking and patch-making, I discovered that for my sounds, I didn't need dual amp chains that often, so I have all my flexibility back...So am I complaining about these limitations? No. Because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary. I'd take off a full star for this shortcoming, but the fact is the unit sounds good enough that I can't do it.There will, at some point, I hope, be a next-generation of this technology which will possibly address some of the usability shortcomings, but I have to say, for this price, I am totally satisfied with the sound!In the meantime, am I willing to trade the flexibility of my former rig for the sound of this one? Heck yes, it sounds that good. I even love the models of amps I know I'll never use for the first time ever.... And after a few months of experimenting, I was able to make patches that completely worked for my two-voice guitar stuff... with NO additional outboard gear if I didn't want. So I've simplified to where I wanted to, and no longer feel like I'm really compromising anything.So... started with a rig consisting of the HD500, and sometimes an M13, and an acoustic preamp (currently a Yamaha AG-Stomp) mixed in with the HD signal through the aux input. I've now gotten to the point where I can do everything I want, if I need, without the additional pedals, and I sold the M13. I kept a few analog pedals and such that I just like, but rarely take them out of the house anymore.I'm only nit-picking so that you will know all the trade-offs. For what I have been fantasizing about, basically an M13 in form and function with a handful of amp models shoved in the box, this is as close as we're probably going to come. And, did I mention... the SOUND! It's seriously great!UPDATE! I have learned that I will indeed have no problem replacing my M13 as well, and sold it off. I thought I'd miss it, but I don't.UPDATE! As of February 2012, I have supplemented this product with a black James Tyler Variax JTV59 (Korean), and it's a marriage made in heaven!

That's because the DigiTech Bad Monkey Tube Overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by BOSS or the $100 TS-9 Tubescreamer.In fact the TS-9 Tubescreamer is the pedal the Bad Monkey is best compared to.  This is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game - it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone.  Notes will sing and chords will really crunch, especially in blues and classic rock.  But since the pedal works well as a level/gain boost, I've heard of guitarists turning on the Bad Monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects, to really push them to new levels.But the best feature of the Bad Monkey by far is the two-band EQ.  Virtually any distortion pedal has a \"Tone\" control that will make the tone darker or brighter.  But since one band EQ basically takes away bass to add treble (or vice versa), you may not find the sound you want.  That's what's so great about the Bad Monkey - if you feel like your tone is too weak, you can fatten it up.  If it's too muddy, you can add treble.  And you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like.Construction is extremely durable - die cast metal, and probably heavier than a BOSS pedal.  The switch is more similar to a BOSS than an Ibanez pedal, but I find that easier to use.If you're a beginning player or a player on a budget, this would be an outstanding pedal to own, along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal.  There's really no need to spend the extra money on a Tubescreamer, if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear.

I cat speak to playing out with this yet, as i am mostly messing around in my little home studio, but i definitely havent heard any crackle on my recordings or when just amping up and letting loose. So, for such a simple device, you really cant beat it...unless you dont really use boxes.

The key to me is the lower end 100 series Monster cables,Monster S100-I-12 Standard 100 1/4-Inch Instrument Cable (12 Feet). The answer is mixed, and depends on what you are looking for.The cable ends are very heavy, they are metal and do unscrew. In some ways this is probably good, they feel good in your hand plugging and unplugging. The jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime. On the other hand, the series 100 plugs are a molded plastic end, with a good bit of flex to them, and they are lighter weight. So the choice is, heavy, shiny gold; or light weight, gray/black? For me, I like the heft of these cables.Construction-wise these are likely lifetime cables. Check out the pictures I've posted. The metal housing screws into the jack. There is an O-ring to seal the top portion of the threads. Inside the wires are soldered solidly to the jack, and then the whole thing is cast in solid acrylic or plastic. Unless you run over this end with a truck or pulled really really hard like tug of war, the wire is never separating from the jack. I don't think the actual 1/4 inch jack is any sturdier than other jacks.Sound is excellent. They are clear clean cables. Are they better than the 100's? Oh maybe a tiny bit. Maybe a little clearer, cleaner sound. But it isn't a huge difference.Bottom line, for gigging, probably go with the 100's. The jack ends will get stepped on at some point and they are cheap enough to replace. For practice or in your house, these are probably the way to go. They do look particularly good plugged into a Marshall half stack.These cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else Monster Cable.

It is not nearly as heavy as I would expect a 100W amp to be, but seems well put together.ControlsThe III comes with a 2 button Foot Pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly. (You can expand to add an optional 4 button switch that Fender sells separately and also includes in the IV and V.)On the amp, you have separate EQ knobs (Treble, Mids and Low) you have a gain, a volume, a Master Volume and a Reverb. Along with these, you also have an LCD screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals, presets, delays and reverbs. You also have separate buttons for changing Amp models, reverb, delays and modulation effects. The large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets, and once you press it, you can go into deep editing of the amp models, effects and presets.The controls are intuitive and easy to use. It is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs.Comparing to other amps:The Fender GDEC 3 does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself. You need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly. But on the Mustang III, you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer.I don't know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful.The Sound (Most important)Let me first compare this amp to what Line 6, Vox, and Peavy have offered in the past. All of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects... BUT... How many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them? Line 6 offers tons of sounds... most of them are what I would call \"niche\" sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro, or some crazy effects laden sound. What I find with Line 6 is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed. They don't sound overdriven, they just sound distorted. Also, Line 6 offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock, metal, and maybe even some weird jazz fusion. These sounds are unique and interesting, but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that I love and looking for useful rock, blues, and metal tones.What I can say about the Mustang III is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed. The Vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds. These are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the Real Thing. You can find the actual base amp models in memory banks 88-99. By playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps. A few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are:'57 Champ This amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little 8 inch Champ. Tons of character and tone. You can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model. Think the Jimi Blues cd. The presets that use this amp that Fender created are all really fun and sound amazing.Fender Bassman Wow! You can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model. It has the recognizable tone of the Bassman modeled really well. Big Bold bottom end with some singing highs.'65 Deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model. Throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock/blues. Or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone.The British Amps are all good models of Vox and Marshall type amps. They are all bold and in your face. Just play one ACDC riff into the 70's amp and you'll recognize the sound.As far as the Vintage tones go...I dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere. If you play rock, blues, Country, hard rock or Jazz, you have so many great choices. People who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs.What surprises me is that Fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music. I was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good.I was wrong. The 90's stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it. I'm pretty sure that this is a Mesa Boogie type of model. This is certainly your Metallica amp.The 2000 metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too.The BIG bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the SuperSonic. This amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal, thrash or whatever. If you overdrive it with a built in pedal, you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this. I play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that I like. I personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this SuperSonic amp.The fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones. You can have one guy who sets all 100 presets with vintage tones, and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash. It is limitless.I would, without a doubt choose this amp over ANY modeling amp out there for practice and fun.I own a pimped out MIM Strat, and a off-the-rack Classic Vibe Strat and Tele as well as a Les Paul style guitar. They ALL sound very cool on this amp. The Classic Vibe 60's Strat really impresses me through this amp. So versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound. I am really loving it!This amp can play really really loud with it's 100 Watts, but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes. (I have 4 kids and practice at night, and this amp is perfect.)Fender Fuse and Ableton SoftwareI have to admit that I really don't feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what I can do manually on the amp. However, You'll find amazing tones all over the Fender Fuse. The system is super easy to use and store on your amp. As with any open online forum, you will have to wade through tones that you don't love and aren't described well. But you will find some gems too.I have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet, so I will have to save that review for later.The FINAL WORDI am a Father of 4 who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes. I like Vintage tones as much as Heavy stuff, so I like a variety of tones. I hate overprocessed guitar tones. This amp is perfect for me. Perfect. The amp models are great, and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds. It comes with a built in tuner, tap tempo effects, a two button footswitch, an effects loop, a digital interface, deep editing computer software, a headphone jack, a usb port, recording software, and moreAt $299 This amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased. I have a $300 strat that I love that sounds beautiful through it. After buying it, I have listed a Tube amp and several effects pedals that I have loved because I no longer will play it.There is no better modeling amp for my needs!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Modeling Amp for Vintage Tones.", "unixReviewTime": 1297296000, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2011"},

Still, I've had to concede that the amps I've been using--a Roland KC150, then a KC350--had plenty of power and pop but no sonic attributes that would recommend them above the Bose P.A. set-up the band uses.  Then, because I needed a small amp with an XLR connection for use as an emergency P.A., I picked up this relatively new item from Roland, which prominently describes itself as a \"monitor\" amp (i.e. meant only for the performer's ears).Was I surprised when I got this thing home and put it through some rounds with a Kurzweil PC2 and SP2.  It's little more than a compact brick, but it appears to have the power of my KC150 and, more importantly, in terms of \"listenability\" it sounds like its several heavens apart from the KC 150 or 350 (those ever-present Roland KC amps will make any piano, including Rolands, sound uninspiring if not boring during the course of a four-hour gig).  This latest contender covers the entire piano range, effortlessly, smoothly, providing rich yet responsive bass where its needed and brilliant but not strident highs.  Perhaps some would judge the sound a trifle \"colored.\"  If so, I'll take the coloration any day to the untempered sounds I've been getting from electric keyboards.  The mid-range is tight and controlled, with the upper register \"growing out\" of it gradually but unmistakably.  By contrast, the upper register on the heavy-duty KC amps strikes like a serpent, leaping out of the mix like home-brewed white lightning  hitting the palate after it's just gotten accustomed to a vintage Bordeaux.I even compared this little thing to my previous standard--the Roland Cube 60 that had preceded the KC150 (which has been around too long).  This new one was smoother, bending to the bass notes like a gracious willow and springing to the top ones like fresh spring birch.  In other words, even the Roland Cube sounded uneven and rough compared to this latest overachiever, which handled the tones of the scale like a single portamento, revealing no holes in any of the registers.Playing any instrument or amplifier on the job can lead to a judgment radically different from the one made at home.  If my instruments (I'm usually playing 2-3) have to be mixed through the P.A., fine.  I won't have to listen to them.  They'll be processed by this monitor, which will be facing and playing for me before it kicks out the stuff that the bandleader deems worthy of the public's ears.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Emancipation Proclamation", "unixReviewTime": 1248652800, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2009"},

I give the MXR Custom Comp five stars because, while it sounds nowhere near as good nor is as easy to use as a Keely, you will pay substantially less. On the other hand, it sounds better than a Boss CS-3 and is more versatile than an MXR Dyna Comp. It is also cheaper than the MXR 76 Vintage Compressor (which has no LED or AC adaptor). So, I think that the MXR Custom Comp is worth considering when shopping for a compressor. You should watch demos on YouTube and many stores sell MXR so you can try one out. If you want an inexpensive compressor with LED, AC adaptor, and a versatile sound palette, then the MXR Custom Comp is pretty good.Anyone who argues that compression does not change your tone has not fully explored the potential of a compressor. If you would like some evidence, consider a song like The Fixx \"One Thing Leads to Another\" which was created in part by cranking a compressor up. The manual gives three settings you might try--\"Chicken Pickin',\" \"New Wave Reggae,\" and \"Chime Bloom\"--each of which sounds different. The MXR Custom Comp can also give you volume boost if you wish to use it for that function, and I think it does so wayyyyy better than the Boss CS-3 (which seems more apt at volume drop, you have to crank it all the way to get a boost).One problem with this compressor is that there are four control knobs, two on the exterior (Output & Sensitivity) and two in the interior (Attack & Trim). In order to set it as the manual suggests, you will have to open up the case with a screwdriver and turn the two dials inside the box. Because of that, I just set it on \"New Wave Reggae\" (for 80s sounds, funk, etc.) and manipulate the external controls as needed. If I was playing country, I would simply switch it to \"Chicken Pickin'\" and leave it. If you are playing multiple styles, I would seek a different compressor like a 4-knob Keely.A second problem with the MXR Custom Comp is noise. If you crank the Output up, it creates a buzz (in my rig) that can be taken care of with a noise gate. The Dyna Comp does the same thing, but I did not hear that as much on the Keely or Boss CS-3.I find that leaving the compressor on all the time sharpens my tone without taking it over, but at the same time I can easily vary the Sensitivity to get different tone/sustain. It can give an awful lot of bell-like sustain on clean sounds and works great with a chorus pedal.BOTTOM LINE:(1) Nice compressor for the price, especially if you want versatile sound palette, good volume boost(2) Hard to work with due to interior controls (dumb!)(3) Generates noisy signal when cranked(4) Gives sound like MXR 76 Vintage Comp with less cost, plus on/off LED & AC adaptor at cheaper price(5) Good compressor in its price range (Keely is far superior in sound but you pay for it!)(6) OK paint job, doesn't really catch my eye", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Bargain for Compressor", "unixReviewTime": 1362355200, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2013"},

Gray \"yargnad\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "really you hate warm, sustaining, natural-tube overdrive; you won't like it at all. This is my favorite OD pedal that I have. I have compared it to the Vox ValveTone OD, the OD side of a EHX Germanium4 BMP, a EHX Linear Power Boost(my second favorite), an Ibanez TS5(90s model) and a Boss Fender Bassman FBM-1. They all have their uses but I find the MojoMojo to be the most versatile, warm and punchy OD I have. I pretty much use it as my base tone to push a lightly crunchy tube amp into overdrive. This thing really wants to sing to you. There are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers. That's not to say it doesn't have some serious punchiness on the low end, which it does; so much that there is a voice switch that will cut the bass a little to keep it from getting too flubby on the neck pickups. I pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers. Single coils really benefit from the round lows this pedal dishes out and I am guessing that's why there is the voice switch.The knobs/pots are nice and the bass/treble pots are notched at 12. Turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts. The drive goes from really clean and subtle, like a  mild boost, up to super drive territory. I actually prefer the sound of this pedal to a Fulltone OCD, it just sounds a little more livelier to me. I really like to push this pedal into the Fender Bassman pedal and get some seriously chimey bell-like highs with a medium crunch by setting it to a mild boost level and upping the gain on the FBM-1, as a third channel of sorts, and it sounds like a totally different amp stack.Like I said, this has become the base of my tone now in just the short amount of time I have had it. I was using the EHX Linear Boost to perform these duties before, and it performs well, but the soulful tone I get from the MojoMojo just adds the extra dimensionality that the pure boost doesn't. I play mostly original compositions but I am going for the Jeff Beck tone and this helps me get where I want to go.Of course none of this means I will stop buying OD pedals... |o)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Don't buy this pedal if......", "unixReviewTime": 1357862400, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2013"},

You can just keep it in your pocket and wipe it once between songs if you want. Doesn't get any easier. Great product!**********************A note about the mixed reviews. I REALLY wish Amazon would separate the 3 different cloths instead of lumping them into one product page. It really isn't fair to the actual good product to have it's rating artificially lowered by bad reviews for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM. It also causes confusion to potential buyers because they have to sift through every review to find the ones that apply to the actual product they want. When I go to the product page for the AMAZINGLY GOOD micro-fiber cloth and see horrible reviews about fraying and lint, it makes me sad. I have had both of the other items, and this micro-fiber cloth is NOTHING like the other 2. This item has sewn/seamed edges that will not fray. It NEVER leave lint behind and it removes fingerprints & smudges and leaves only a nice clean instrument behind. No scratches, no lint, no hint it was ever there. My guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth, and I use the thing almost every day.I got on this rant bc I came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it. I told him I would just get another. Then I came here and couldn't remember which version I bought, and the negative reviews seemed to be talking about a completely different item (leaves behind lint?? What the crap are they talking about?)...turns out they are talking about a completely different item. I looked up my purchase history and found I had bought the Micro-fiber, then I placed an order for 2 more (1 for me, 1 to give away, again).Putting a single item type on a page and having selectors for size or color is fine of course. Putting an apple and a lemon on the same page (literally) and lumping bad reviews for a horrible product in with great reviews for a wonderful product is just an error that needs to be fixed. At least now if you managed to find this lone clarifying review hidden among the dozens of other mismatched ones, you know what version to buy and which to avoid.Anyway, /End rant.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This Is Awesome!

Initially, I was a little disappointed in that very little wood grain shows through the orangish finish. (My guitar was made in China, which may account for the darker hue.) I thought I had wanted a lighter color, but the more I look at it the happier I am with what I have. Second, this instrument is no light-weight, either in heft or playability. It is solidly constructed, very well put together, and plays like a dream. (I lowered the action until I encountered some fret buzz, then backed off the adjusting screws just a bit; that's basically the only adjustment I've made, or likely will make.)It's been barely a day since the guitar arrived and, as yet, I've only played it unplugged.

I haven't had an electric in years, and didn't have the budget to get a Gibson, so picked up this Epi Les Paul 100 instead, along with a Fender Mustang I Amp.  Great combination.  This guitar has a very sloid feel, and came set-up perfectly right out of the box.  All it needed was tuning.  Unlike others, I didn't feel that the strings I got needed to be changed right away, but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them.  Replaced mine with Ernie Ball \"Not Even Slinky's\" and couldn't be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds.  Great sustain, beautiful harmonics, the clean tones are warm, can get nice blues tones out of it, and superb thrash metal too.  Very versatile.  It does not quiet do country or jazz, but it wasn't really meant to.The action is extremely easy, fret board has a great feel to it, good width on the neck, not too slinder but not too thick.  It just feels good in your hands.The finish on this product is very nice.  One thing though, the pick guard is kind of a tan / cream off white color, not bright white as pictured, but it still looks great.Also, not mentioned in the description, but this does come with a 12 foot cord, but it's not the best quality.

It's solid as a rock with chrome handles, edge guards and a pig snout for the volume control.It looks like a mini suit case and contrary to another review, the AC adapter fits into a compartment inside so it may be stored internally.  It also operates on batteries which makes this little thing quite the gem to take with us this summer.  Now I can take the Fender or Gibson electrics rather than the acoustic.Okay, I keep getting off topic here...The sound is clear and crisp for it's size.  Sure, it's not my Fender Mustang IV, but I didn't pay 600 bucks for it either.  But then my Fender doesn't have a pig's snout!!  There are no controls on this for tone adjustments, just a volume knob.  But, most of our modern electric guitars have quite a bit of tone adjustment anyway.  I would compare the sound coming from it as above average but it's the novelty of the amp that is the real attraction, for me anyway.As for it's size, I would say it's just about the size of your average small jewelry box.  But it's much heavier, deceptively heavy but I like that.  It doesn't have that &#34;cheap&#34; feel about it.Like I said, I WILL use this occasionally, especially during summer months when we cruise in the convertible or in the conversion van.  I look forward to the comments the amp will get, I'm sure way more than my guitar playing skills as I still have a lot to learn.  But, learning should be fun and this little amp and is just another way to make it even more fun.In summary, I would highly recommend this to any pig lover who owns a guitar or to anyone who's looking for a portable amp that operates on either batteries or an AC adapter.A word to best describe it....&#34;COOL&#34;.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WAY better, louder and clearer than I ever expected  AND IT IS SO CUTE!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1390348800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2014"},

{"reviewerID": "A1LCG14GZJI5LO", "asin": "B000Y7Q2C4", "reviewerName": "Andrew M.", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I love this capo. Let me tell you about my capo journey where I've used every brand while searching for this one. First, I always owned the old Dunlop Toggle Action capo which is just old tech, you know, where it's just a bundle of synthetic cotton fiber, the kind one used to use before 1980. I had to go back to that when my first Planet Waves black THERMOPLASTIC capo broke. Don't buy those if you live in a damp climate like CA. Each one I bought broke, one broke within a week, during the winter rainy days. So I loved those capos, they were perfect, but I was done with the breaking, so I figured I'd try others instead despite my love for the Planet Waves design (I didn't know about the silver aluminum one yet). Well, I hated each other one I tried. Kyser, if you have had carpal and/or are small handed, you know what I mean, you don't want a capo that involves squeezing really hard so that your hands are in pain and then you don't want to play the guitar. I really hate the Kysers (I know some folks love to squeeze and use them, that's fine, different strokes right). Then I tried the Schub, you have to be kidding me. OMG that thing is so ridiculous, it pops off, it wiggles about, it is tricky, I hate it. Now, I know many folks are Schub fans who give me a drive by downrate, I'm not saying it isn't great for those who love it. If you love the Schub, you love it unconditionally, and I respect that, all I'm saying is that design is not for me and many other folks like me. There are other models that fail similarly to these 2, they make you squeeze so hard it does hurt for those like myself with sensitive hands, like the G7, I did fall in love with it until maybe the 5th squeezing and then you have to hurt your hand by unsqueezing it apart to put it back on. Awk~ward and painful. Sorry to be such a softie and a crybaby, but if you have carpal, you know what I mean, you want to go easy on the hands and arms, and not brutalize them. The other thing I've always hated about the Kysers (and again it may be that my smaller physique is involved) is how it gets in the way so chording with a capo is a lot harder. That's just dumb. Kyser lovers either accept that as a challenge or don't mind it or claim it doesn't do that, but you know what I'm talking about. Ok, so then because of all the broken Planet Waves thermoplastic capos, I turned next to Dunlop's turnscrew models. I liked them, they are very similar to the PW design, but the screw location is more awkward to use, and turning their screws is a lot harder on the fingers (got the ripped and pained fingertips to show for it). So, I turned back in search for a better Planet Waves model. This is it, right here. The silver one is excellent, and it's made of aluminum, not thermoplastic. I bought one and it has lasted me almost 3 years now without a single problem. By now, in contrast, I would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplastic ones. I want to say that if you are performing in a public venue, never use the thermoplastic ones, because my thermoplastic ones dramatically burst and flew across the room, and could easily \"poke someone's eyes out\". Not kidding, don't use those in public situations. Back to the excellent aluminum silver PWaves capo. I love it, because it doesn't break, not at all, and has all of the great thermoplastic model features that make it the best capo ever (especially for us sensitive folks with carpal or small handed people etc). The great features are:1. Ease of use and easy fitting are perfect, the best of all capos. This capo fits so easily. Simply put it on the fretboard and the location of the screw is perfect-- you never have to move the guitar or your hand more than a couple inches, unlike the other screwtops or all other capos, there's no need for any moving around, adjusting the guitar, falling down due to balance issues and then chasing a falling guitar, sheesh none of that nonsense. You put it on and they've engineered it brilliantly so you can easily get it on, move it from fret to fret, put it where you want, and screw it in with great ease! Wow, best ever in this category. Ease of use is tops, ever!2. It will never hurt you, it only helps. It weighs nothing, is easy to carry, you can slip it onto the peg area, it just is so light. I still can't believe how light it feels.3. It does what it's supposed to, that other capos don't do. No issues with being in tune, just screw it in to the level of tightness you desire, no wrestling around like some capos do. The screw is in the most easy location, and the screw itself is nicely made so it doesn't hurt your fingers at all when you screw and unscrew, it's a breeze. No problems with the size, it's so small, it doesn't get in your way on the fretboard. You won't have to do hand yoga in order to play capo'd songs, it is FLAT (I know, what a concept!). A capo should always be flat and out of your way so you can play chords, not pretzeled twister instead of chords. Now, I play capo'd songs all the time because of this capo, and it is so much fun musically, a whole new magical experience. The truth I've found is that good equipment matters in music making (I never played acoustic guitar as well or as much until I got my first Applause guitar with great action. I have a Yamaha I love now (since the Applause necks break), but both guitars taught me that you have to have good equipment that's easy to use (in the case of guitars, great action is imperative. In the case of capos, ease of use and no pain produced is imperative, and it opens up the world of capo use, the magic of the mathematics of music theory.)If you love the other brands, don't diss me, I know it's perfect for you, and I'm happy for you that it works perfectly for you, because when you have the best one for you, you will shine with your music and I will enjoy listening to you play. But those of you who have sensitive or small hands or have carpal know what I'm talking about, you won't settle for the torture of Kysers and Schubs, gotta be kidding me. I bought every capo imaginable (need to have a garage sale to get rid of the pile) but ended up that I was using the old toggle type again instead until I found the aluminum Silver Planet Waves Capo. Planet Waves has made the perfect capo now, no more issues, just easy fun playing capo'd songs. Again, only buy the Silver model, because when/if you get silver, you are guaranteed to get aluminum, not thermoplastic.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best EVER!

I spent over 8 years in professional radio and 30 plus years doing voice over recording and sound mixing, so I have heard and used all types of mics and I have to rate the Blue Yeti at the top of my list for many reasons. First is sound quality, all the patterns have a smooth, open sound, the cardioid pattern has added richness for voice over work, comparable dare I say to a Sennheiser or Sure. The sound in all the patterns was not colored or muted at any frequency level, which what is I was expecting in the stereo mode, but in that pattern, voices sound great and an acoustic guitar sounded rich, plucky and natural. Next is the construction of the mic and stand, from the pictures I was expecting plastic, nope, it is made of very solid metal , except the buttons and switches. Third is the versatility, you can record almost anything in any type of circumstance not just adequately, but with excellence, try that with a $2,000.00 Neumann! The set up could not be easier, just plug it into your USB jack and let her rip. I only paid $100.00 on Amazon,a true bargain, for what is a top notch piece of gear, where the engineers of this product really took their time to design something of real quality and looks like a piece of art. The Yeti also stands up to audio processing, where I have to say all of the other mics I have used for under $200.00 show their weaknesses. The only thing I would like to see is a shock mount made for this mic, it is just too big for all of my other mounts, but the Yeti does not seem to pick up as much vibration from the table as other mics do (I also use a slab of 1/4\" neoprene padding to absorb some table shock), and the Yeti has no real audible self noise. If you want a great microphone at an incredible price, the Blue Yeti is the one for you!Addendum 9-30-2011My complaint about the shock mount has been resolved, with the Blue Radius, which I received a week ago from Amazon, which I love. Makes this great, and I mean great microphone even better. I have done side by side comparisons to the Neumann U87, the Sennhieser D421, the Lawson L47, all top notch and very expensive studio mics. The Yeti sounds as good. Of course you have to learn how to work a microphone properly to get the right sound. I cringe at some YouTube demos of this mic, some of the folks are not using this, and I'm sure other mike's correctly to get the best sound.

Both the TU-2 and Pitchblack are excellent, and I don't really have an opinion yet as to which is better.  However, there are some strengths of the Korg Pitchblack that may lead you to prefer it over other tuners.  The primary draw here is the bright light-up display with wide color bars.  The tuner displays the note you are closest to, and the colors guide you to the perfect pitch, marked by the green light in the middle (almost like an airplane landing guide).  But not only do the lights indicate tone by turning on and off, they actually dim and transition into one another as you go across those semi-tones.  You could argue, therefore, that the visual guide is giving you a lot more precision than you would get from a simple on/off light.  The tuner works quickly and reliably.The build quality is outstanding, and it's true bypass.  When you step on the pedal, the tuner is on and the guitar signal is off.  The switch is also of the \"soft button\" variety, similar to what you find on some Vox pedals and many boutiques.  It has a nice feel to it, though it could be easier to bump if it's in a high traffic area.This is a great tuner at a reasonable price.

I had no knowledge of or experience with the original full-sized Hot Tubes pedal from the late 1970's.  And, frankly, many of the reviews I read online about both the original and the reissue were less than flattering.  I think part of that hatred comes from the fact that you have an analog pedal without actual tubes that claims (both in the name of the device and in the artwork on the casing) to sound like an overdriven tube amplifier.  Really, though, if you think about it, doesn't EVERY overdrive pedal (including the venerable Tubescreamer) make that same claim?When I plugged into the Hot Tubes, I was surprised, but immediately intrigued.  I actually ended up purchasing this over the excellent East River Drive, which was very good, but also a very &#34;familiar&#34; sounding clone of a TS-808.  What the Hot Tubes does is anything but &#34;familiar&#34; from an affordable OD pedal.This pedal has a significant amount of output, and (unlike many other overdrives) it has considerable low end.  In fact, it likely even adds bass to your sound.  There is a tone circuit bypass switch that I do not fully understand.  Basically, with the switch off, there is no tone control, and they advertise this sound as &#34;powerful&#34; and touch-responsive. Since the pedal trends to the darker side of things, however, I actually left it in the &#34;on&#34; position and worked the tone from the 12:00 to 1:30 settings.The gain structure is as bizarre as it is unique, though it actually starts to make sense if you think about how gain responds on an actual vintage tube amp.  From the 7:00 (0%) setting up to around 12:00, your tone basically remains clean, provided you started with a clean signal.  My setup was a Strat into a Fender Super Champ X2, which is a tube/hybrid amp with a great clean &#34;Blackface&#34; setting.  However, the Hot Tubes completely transforms that tone.  That setting on my amp is normally bright with some great upper end chime, but the Hot Tubes offered a thick, smokey tone that was mostly clean, with maybe a bit of muffled grit mixed into it.As you start get past 12:00 on the overdrive knob, the amount of gain increases exponentially.  At this point, the pedal behaves more like an overdrive, though the gain is almost fuzz-like.  Some people have described it as a &#34;Jack White&#34; type of sound, but I'll really leave it to individual users to decide if they &#34;like&#34; it or not.There are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about.  First, I want to make clear that this is a DARK, bassy pedal.  In that respect, it is completely different from the EXH Soul Food and East River Drive, both of which have some measure of bass drop.  The tone circuit only helps to open up the tone a slight bit, but it could do more.  I do not believe this is the type of overdrive you would stack with - it might actually benefit from a brighter overdrive stacking INTO it.  If your rig is already on the dark or muffled side, you may want to stay away from this pedal.  That being said, I would definitely recommend &#34;try before buy&#34; with this one because it is different in hard-to-describe ways.For now, my rating is 5 stars - solid EHX construction, very compact, accessible 9V jack (on the top where it I like it), and a unique overdrive sound at an affordable price that doesn't sound at all like the other overdrives I have.  It certainly won't be for everybody, but so far, I like what I hear.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reissued vintage circuit, somehow stands out as \"unique\" overdrive", "unixReviewTime": 1391558400, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2014"},
{"reviewerID": "A2KI91IR3RA7D0", "asin": "B0002E4Z8M", "reviewerName": "David L. Vasser", "helpful": [10, 10], "reviewText": "You are looking at what I consider to be the best friend a voice ever had.  During a 40 year broadcast and voiceover career I have used (or been forced to use) every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the Shure SM7B and it's predecessors the SM7 and SM5.Large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi-track studio work.  I've used over the years the Sennheiser MD421, EV RE20, EV RE27N/D, Shure SM7B, Shure SM7, Shure SM5 and most recently tried a Heil PR-40.  Sometimes this was not of my own selection, but I just used what was available.  Of the lot the Shure SM7B is my favorite of the ones still available.  The SM7B is a better shielded SM7 and the SM7B of today has a better shock mount than the old SM7 or earlier SM7B.  The shielding in the B model minimizes RFI from computer monitors, florescent lighting, radio transmitter proximity, etc.  The SM7 was a redesign of the SM5.  I consider the SM5 to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn't been in production in ages.  I have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the RCA 77DX and RCA 44 but they were not as good as the SM5 or SM7 or SM7B.Today's SM7B is the best non-condenser vocal microphone still in production.  Stop looking and buy one.  You will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word.  It has a very controllable proximity effect, something that is missing from the EV's.  I can play a SM7B like a violin, the others I just don't seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact.Everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an SM7B while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn't.DJ's change jobs a lot and I got tired of finding the EV RE20 & RE27N/D mics or the Sennheiser everywhere I went, so I bought my own SM7B.  I never liked the EV's or Sennheiser much and didn't ever feel like they were much of a tool.  The Heil PR-40 is pretty good but doesn't have any on-board EQ options.  For recording not having the EQ is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can't do much of that.The SM7B is a tool for skilled vocal talent, so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an RE27N/D but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the SM7B is only dynamic large diaphragm mic I know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give.  The reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing, voice work.  The others are more versatile, but the SM7B is \"THE VOICE\" microphone and that was all it was intended to be. It has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects, but it is primarily a vocal microphone.Of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast, the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably.  That is one reason vocals sound good on a $4,000 tube condenser microphone, since it can capture all the complexity, inflection and multi-frequency overtones of the human voice.  Unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn't intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise.  If you are doing a dry voiceover you can't hide the hiss of a condenser under something else.  With the SM7B you don't have to.Even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves \"Recording Engineers\" today are usually totally ignorant about.  They figure anything short of a multi-thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong.If you want a good all around microphone, this is NOT it.  If you want the best dynamic vocal microphone, here it is.  As others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear I've ever connected to it.  I think if you have some cheap USB interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers.  Most real studio preamps are a good match for it. I've plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too.  You need at least 60 dB of gain, the spec sheet actually says 59.  70 dB would be better. Lots is made of the \"LOW OUTPUT\" of -59 dB but it isn't all that much less than the Shure SM58 which is -54.5 dB! -4.5 dB isn't much at all for any decent mic preamp.  But again most of the \"one-box-solution\" USB interfaces with built-in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind.The Shure SM7B comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments.  Every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra.  They all need an external windscreen but only the SM7B comes with one! I got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens.  It has a nice metal case for storage/travel.  I think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one Shure calls the A7WS but still come in the metal case.  I use the smaller windscreen mostly and Shure calls them the RK345 and their distributors still carry them. The smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and I'd suggest getting one of the RK345's, but that is the only accessory you'll need to add.  The windscreens are held on by some little Velcro tabs but easily interchanged.  They are also very durable for foam screens.On the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple EQ adjustments for Flat/Bass Rolloff/Presence Boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best. You can just leave the plate off if you want. This is easily the most EQ flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic.So I'm just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work.  I should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new Heil PR-40 first to make sure I was still an SM7B guy and it took a while for the Heil tryout to happen since I didn't want to actually buy one.  I still am an SM7B guy.  I would give it 4.5 stars but it won't let me do that, since there is nothing better right now in the class I rounded it up to 5 stars, but the SM5 was actually a bit closer to a 5 star vocal mic.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Vocal Dynamic Microphone Still In Production!", "unixReviewTime": 1354147200, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2012"},

We needed some stand-alone microphone preamps and after searching the internet I decided to give this Behringer unit a try.This single rack space unit provides two independent microphone preamps, each of which is equipped with a single band of sweepable parametric equalization to adjust the timbre of the final output. Before I even tried the piece as a preamp I opened it up to look inside.DO NOT EXPECT TO CHANGE THE TUBEThe tube is mounted in such a way that it is probably impossible to change it out for a different one.Fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube. There is no schematic provided so it's really impossible to say how the tube is implemented in the circuit and how much it actually contributes to the tone of the unit.HOW DOES IT SOUNDThe preamps sound very good, full, rich, crisp highs, deep lows, it's a function of the microphone you connect to it as far as I can tell. For comparison I A-B compared this preamp to our very expensive API 3124+ preamp which is a 4-channel unit that we paid over $500 per preamp-channel for, that is 10-times the price per channel of this Behringer unit. I'm not going to say the Behringer beat the API but they were a dead heat in most listening tests. My female partner who is not too technical (but has great ears) thought the Behringer was just as good as the API. We also have a Grace m801 which is another over-$500/channel preamp, she definitely liked the Behringer sound better than the Grace (personally I think it was the EQ on the Behringer that affected her choice when comparing to the Grace).If my API or Grace preamps go toast I will definitely have them repaired. If the Behringer dies, it's going in the trash and I'll buy another one. It's simple economics and at $100 for two preamps that sound as good as they do these are really nice. They sound good. They have an industry standard packaging. The input and output connectors are excellent. It even has a line input mode so you can add a little tube distortion to a line-level signal (I have not tried this because we don't need it).We broadcast between three and ten, live one-hour shows per week using this preamp for vocals. NOBODY in our listening audience has ever complained and none of them know we switched from our high-end pieces to this very inexpensive preamp. Now our expensive preamps are back over in our production studio and are used for recording tracks that play behind our live performances during the shows.RELIABILITYWe have not had any problems with this unit. It is warmed up for an hour before each broadcast, I've never heard any noise or bad stuff come from it. We have A LOT of Behringer gear in our studio, it lives right along side gear from Neve, API, Allen and Heath, UA, Meyer, Lexicon and Apogee. Out of 103 pieces of Behringer equipment I've bought we've had two pieces that had problems and those occurred right out to the box. I had much worse reliability with Crown amplifiers than Behringer products and I really like Crown amps, regardless of the problems, they just sound so good. In my experience the Behringer products have provided professional results for an amazing low price.

Clark", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Having to send the first Snark SN-8 back, but the replacement, thus far, has been flawless.I made a slight adjustment to my guitar's truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot on.A couple tips to tuning a guitar: tune it like you play it. If you strum & play softly, then pluck & tune each string softly.However, most people don't play softly, so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes: they pluck each string and wait like 15 seconds till the ringing fades out, & so they are generally tuning each string as it begins \"softly\" resonating.So, in essence, what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat.To tune your guitar correctly, you really ought to pluck each string hard, like every 2 seconds and tune it that way - rather than waiting for the sound to fade out. If you do it this way, you might be surprised at how good it sounds when you're strumming the living daylight out of it!Also, please check your intonation. Your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings. You pluck your open string (hard) & tune as described above. Then you check intonation by pressing VERY LIGHTLY (with JUST the TIP of your FINGER and DON'T TOUCH ANY OTHER PART of the NECK), on the same string, but 12th fret - and BOTH should be in tune the EXACT same.If they are off (12TH & open), then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment. Please don't pay someone to setup your guitar! You can do it yourself so easily. Go on u toob and search \"scott grove tuning your guitar wrong\" and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over 3,000 guitars - & he spends almost an hour explaining all the details. Also, watch his video on how to setup: adjust intonation, truss rod, action, etc.Btw, if you can't get your Snark to tune your guitar: hint - it's not the tuner's fault. The first 3 saddles (e, b, g) should look like a staircase going down. Then, your next 3 strings (d,  a, e) should also look like another staircase going down.

Getting \"demoted\" from the front page.  In any case, even though I recently picked up the Sony PCM-D50 from Amazon, I'm sufficiently impressed by the Zoom H2 to give it 5 stars and endorse it for anyone who wants professional quality results without the grief and expense of 8-16 track digital recorders or even the fuss of more complicated personal recorders.  For quite a while its only competition was the Edirol-R09, but as the price has come down, the Zoom H2 stands out from its immediate competition. Currently, the H2 is my \"back-up\" unit.  But for convenience or stealth purposes, I often use it as my main recorder.Anyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed.  Production values haven't been spared in terms of the packaging; the included equipment (no batteries but a power adapter, protective pouch, handy table stand, mic stand adapter, wind screen, ear buds, USB cable, and a 256mb SD card); and the manual (a quick set-up sheet plus an ample booklet with generous-sized print written in clear, idiomatic English that makes some of Sony's recent instruction manuals look torturous by comparison).The screen and controls, admittedly, are minuscule, requiring sharp eyes (though the screen is well-illuminated) and nimble fingers (I much prefer the knobs and slider switches of my Sony to the touch-pad of the Zoom).  What's encouraging about this recorder, apart from the price, is that the designers at Zoom have made the H2 with the genuine audiophile and/or all-around musician in mind.  It's not simply another \"guitar player's gadget,\" loaded down with an endless supply of effects, loops, rhythm and bass tracks, files within files, programs buried within programs.  The H2, unlike my pricey Sony, can handle both .wav and mp3 protocol, has microphone fields ranging from 90 degrees to 360 degrees,  is capable of applying compression limiting to recorded files, offers a wide range of sensitivity and placement for recording lectures, conversations, solo performers and orchestras.  In short, the device promises to deliver the quality of some of recorders costing a thousand or more--and in a practical digital storage card format.Other Pluses:  Although the instructions are quick to point out the input for an external microphone (the pictured ones are the two popular stereo mics made by Sony, costing $60 and $90 respectively), the Zoom onboard mic (actually 4) is darn good.  It captured the range and resonance of a grand piano and even managed to pick up a conversation in the kitchen and a grandfather clock's  chimes from upstairs.  And it's reassuring to see a mic with a surface area reminiscent of the mics of the past (a single tiny hole is more common these days).  Getting the recorded signal onto a computer's hard-drive is expedited with the included USB.2 cable, and from there you can edit the wave pattern in a program like Cool Edit (which I strongly recommend over editing in the recorder).  There's also a metronome on board (potentially useful for a student musician during practice sessions) and a tuner (useful for a student musician or a pro who wants his instrument to be in tune before recording).Possible drawbacks: 1. Zoom admittedly has overdone things a bit with all of the audiophile bells and whistles--limiters, compressors, cut-off levels, AGC control, auto-dynamic levels, sensitivity ratios, panning effects, and the list goes on.  It's too easy to miss a step, to waste precious time fumbling with the menu, to find your fingers going numb while making all of these tiny adjustments.  Moreover, the instructions, while clear and abundant, omit much information that would help the beginner.  The hypothetical audience keeps changing from someone who's a complete newbie to someone who's a knowledgeable aficionado.  And I have great difficulty imagining a harried band director or impatient student taking the time to fiddle with scrolling through the tiny screen's menu to get to a metronome or tuner. (Frankly, with 75 kids squirming in their seats I'd go to the old single-function, dial-up, block-shaped metronome without a second thought.)2. The H2 is so light that using it with the AC adaptor seems rather incongruous if not highly unlikely.  Undoubtedly you'll want to pick up a 2 to 4 GB SD card and a good supply of double A batteries (it takes only 2) to record in the field.  At standard MP3 (128-meg) quality, you should be good for dozens of hours.  (The adaptor would have made more sense if Zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder.)3. My H2 would not connect to my iMac with OSX Leopard without downloading an upgrade from the Zoom site. After having some difficulty with the install, I decided to forget about it and simply transfer files in \"real time.\"What's encouraging about this recorder, apart from the price (2/3 of the H4, 1/2 of the Edirol R-9) is that the designers at Zoom have made the H2 with the genuine audiophile and/or all-around musician in mind.Perhaps the primary deal-maker or breaker: The tiny screen and small controls.  Until mastering the miniaturization, I would want to have a \"back-up\" cassette recorder for any performance that I judged of special importance.  As for build quality, my H2 is like new after almost 18 months use. Undoubtedly you'll want to pick up a 2 to 4 GB SD card and a good supply of double A batteries (it takes 2) to record in the field.  At standard MP3 (128-meg) quality, you should be good for dozens of hours.  (The adaptor would have made more sense if Zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder.)My H2 would not connect to my iMac with OSX Leopard without downloading an upgrade from the Zoom site. After having some difficulty with the install, I decided to forget about it--especially after seeing how slow (I mean really, \"overnight\" slow) the machine is in \"Normalizing\" a long file or converting it from .wav to mp3.  What takes minutes with a software program like Sound Studio or WireTap Studio requires hours when you're using the Zoom as a computer interface.  Use it for what it does best--namely, produce realistic audio from a tiny, weightless, durable device that practically makes the added attractions gratuitous and frankly puts to shame  its expensive rivals.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Must for Musicians: Rivals the H4n and performs with machines costing 3 times as much: Raising rating after 16 months use.", "unixReviewTime": 1197417600, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2007"},

Then I ordered this pedal and three others (graphic equalizer; MXR carbon copy delay; T-REX reverb)  I figured that I would find a good tone for both blues and other music from something within this combo.  Well everything is being returned except this pedal.  I found that when I plug this pedal into my old 8 watt Peavey Rage, I get better tone and volume than either of the two new amps using them alone or with any combination of the four pedals.  More \"tube-like\" sound than a top-rated tube amp! AND...if I want a cleaner tone, I can dial it back, or bypass it altogether.  My only complaint is that it does not accept a battery.  You must use a 9V transformer, which is not included.  Oh well, my experience with the other pedals was that a battery does not last long anyway.

Like many guitarists, my first distortion pedal was a Boss DS-1, which was durable and aggressive, but also extremely frustrating.  I might have formed some negative impressions about Boss, when it was probably unfair to do so.The SD-1 is widely owned and very affordable (usually around $50).  It's similar in a lot of ways to the Ibanez TS-9 Tubescreamer, except that a Tubescreamer reissue costs twice as much.  A lot of guitarists consider the SD-1 to be more of a \"rock\" overdrive, while the TS-9 is more of a \"tube/blues\" effect.  There's probably some truth to that, but both of them are excellent pedals.However, the SD-1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility.  You CAN simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel.  But that isn't necessarily the best use for the pedal - it excels as a \"booster\" pushing an already overdrive amp, or stacking with other distortion/OD pedals.  One of the best settings is turning the Level all the way up and the gain all the way down.  This adds just a little bit of grit to your tone, and really sounds great.A feel that lot of people give the SD-1 mediocre reviews for reasons that aren't fair.  You hear things like \"it cuts out too much bass\", when that's really what the pedal is supposed to do.  The midrange hump, when set up properly, can take away the muddiness of your tone and help you cut through a band during live playing.  And, like I said before, I feel as if it's MORE transparent in retaining elements of the clean tone than the TS-9, though preference between the two is entirely subjective.But you also know that it's a Boss pedal, which means it's as durable as they come.  The thing will stand up to years of abuse, and can be used in any number of roles.  If you're looking for a single pedal to make a small amp sound \"big\", there are probably better options in this range.  (Try the under-appreciated MD-2 Mega Distortion, or the excellent Joyo Ultimate Drive).

To my ears, the rest were less distinctive.-Priced at $150, seemed a little high although I know there are other pedals that cost more.Overall a nice pedal, I can't really ding it for the cons above so I still gave it 5 stars.

Long story short I was trying to get a podcast going from scratch about three months ago.  I did some research and discovered that a shockmount is necessary to keep any noise from anything securing the mic from being picked up by the mic while recording.  A shockmount is an absolute must, especially when looking at using a tabletop mic stand where the table will also be used as a work surface.The build quality is fantastic.  I just recently purchased my THIRD shockmount for an additional mic to be used on the podcast.What I've grown to appreciate so much is that it seems to fit just about any condenser microphone I can get my hands on.  If you are considering buying this for your own condenser mic, make absolutely sure that your mic has threads on the bottom to be screwed into some type of stand or shockmount.  Nearly all do, but some companies like Blue (Snowball, snowflake, etc.) are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts. I have used the MXL 007.USB with this shockmount as well as the AT2020 USB and XLR version.  The MXL fit like a glove, perfect.  The AT2020, once threaded in, seemed just a bit loose, so I added a couple foam bumpers around the base to act as a washer.  It made a tight fit and further insulated it from any sound interference from any movement.In short, I haven't found a better shockmount for condenser mics.  The attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand.  Fantastic.

{"reviewerID": "ADH0O8UVJOT10", "asin": "B000T4PJC6", "reviewerName": "StormJH1", "helpful": [27, 28], "reviewText": "First off, this is a great, classic pedal that has shaped the tones of rock and blues artists all over the musical map.  It's actually a reissue of the pedals Ibanez made in the 1980's, though there's some debate over whether or not  the modern circuitry retains all of that original tone.  In my opinion, unless you're being purposefully picky or have the most elite of trained ears, you would never be able to tell the difference.  The construction is sturdy (metal and actually heavier-feeling than a BOSS pedal).  The LED light, for some reason, is difficult to see from an angle, but that's largely an irrelevant gripe.But let's be clear what a \"Tube Overdrive\" pedal is and isn't.  This is NOT a distortion petal like the Boss DS-1 or Metal Zone (MT-2).  It is also not a \"fuzz\" pedal like you would hear on a Jimi Hendrix song.  It is not meant for heavy rock/metal/grunge type music.  If you need heavy distortion to mask sloppy playing, the TS9 is not for you.What it DOES do, however, is to boost the signal at the front end, which essentially results in a more dynamic done with additional gain.  This can result in a very midrange-heavy \"blues\" tone (Stevie Ray Vaughan used it quite a bit), or even a nice \"crunch\" overdrive tone (AC/DC) for rhythm work.  Some guitars use it simply to boost their signal without adding a bunch of additional gain.  It also works well with other distortion pedals for that purpose.Long story short - the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer really is one of the more versatile pedals you will use - just don't expect it to create every range of sounds you need right out of the box.  For a cheaper alternative, consider Digitech's surprisingly good \"Bad Monkey\" overdrive pedal, which is half the price and gives you more control over tone.  I've also compared this to BOSS's BD-2 Blues Driver, which is an excellent, but very different style of overdrive.  (The BD-2 has a much hotter output and is more aggressive; the Tubescreamer is more subtle and works in the midrange while retaining your underlying clean tone and responding to picking style).  If you start with a good amp and guitar setup, the Tubescreamer will sound great.  It won't completely transform your tone, but it will give your current tones a boost, make those solos really sing and those rhythm chords really crunch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Classic - But beware what it is and isn't", "unixReviewTime": 1346630400, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2012"},

However, I found all of those too difficult to adjust to my needs, or too cumbersome to flip through all the channels to get to the sound I wanted and then modify it. What I wanted was four or five single effects pedals that I could preset to the value I usually use and then turn on each effect as needed, giving me lots of combinations. I had a couple of Boss pedals and one Behringer one and I ordered a couple more of the inexpensive Behringer units, which I'm generally pleased with, though they're perhaps not in the elite category. They work fine for me. I didn't want 5 or 6 units cluttering up the space and each demanding its own wall wart.This compact board with its built in case and cord management was the perfect solution for me. Instead of the Velcro found on many boards, this has foam cutouts which hold the B and B pedals securely and give enough room for the connectors and daisy chain power supply to stay tangle free. It all plugs in with one adapter (provided) and it also comes with all the short connectors to connect each pedal together.My pedals are  incredibly easy to use and extremely well organized now. The case holds them securely and the lid fits on and holds everything in place for transport. Everything is ready to play by just removing the lid and plugging into the outlet.The latches are not the most secure, just a simple plastic slide that looks like it could easily break. However, there are matching holes right next to them so a small lock or even a twist tie could be inserted if the latch does malfunction.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied. If you're doing something similar to me, I'm sure you will be too. The foam cutouts can be manipulated for other sizes of pedals.

Both the G7s and the SCHUBBs are better known, more commonly used and more expensive. This is one of those rare instances where what you get is NOT what you pay for.

I've owned a number of amps over the years including a 1960s Ampeg 40 Watt combo, and a pre-CBS 100 watt Fender Showman, and my latest, a Crate 5212 50 Watt tube amp that I bought about 10 years ago.  I also have a small Peavy 50 Watt solid state combo.  The Crate has always sounded great, and it's what I use exclusively in my basement studio, but it  weighs a ton and the clean channel has always had a habit of fading in and out (despite numerous repair attempts), so I've been using the Peavy when I play out.  The last time I did, I was really unsatisfied with the sound and decided to look for something else.  I own a Line6 pocket Pod and love it so I looked into the Line6 amps.When I found that I could get a 75 Watt modeling amp with a looper and a more presets than I could go through in a lifetime for less than $300, I ordered one from Amazon, sight unseen and unheard.  Out of the box I was amazed at just about everything.  The clean amp models are crisp and clear, the dirty ones thick and rich.  The effects that I have played around with so far are amazing, and I cannot detect any difference between them and my digital delay, phaser and overdrive pedals that cost about the same as the whole Spider IV 75. And the thing is loud!  Very loud.  As I get more experience with the amp, I'm sure that I'm going to want to tweak the built in presets to my taste, but even right out of the box the sound is pretty awesome.I'm sure that a lot of pro purists out there would laugh at the idea of a 75 Watt solid state combo with 1 12\" speaker as their main amp, and if you've got $1800 to spend and a roadie, I guess they'd be right. But for the money, the sound, the size and the very light weight (36 lbs) alone make this a fabulous deal. Add in the modeling and the effects (high quality individual floor pedals or rack devices to replicate these effects could cost thousands of dollars just by themselves), and compared to my $750 Crate VC5212, at $300 the Spider IV 75 seems like an almost impossibly large gain in overall function. I doubt that I will use my Crate again (except when guests come to jam).And then the less than good...It doesn't come with a foot switch.  You have to buy one if you want to be able to use the looping in any realistic way and/or take advantage of the 4 channels on the fly, and to upload new firmware to the amp.  And of course you really want to do all if that (and more), so a foot controller is essential.  I opted for the FBV Express Mk II, the smallest and least expensive model with a pedal.  It lets me access all 4 channels as well as the looper and acts as a volume/wah controller.  It was another $100.  It is really essential, so in my mind the price of the Spider IV 75 is really just under $400.And  it doesn't come with any manuals to speak of.  All the manuals are available online for free, but of course you have to download them and print them.  And these manuals are essential to access all but the most basic functions of the amp. If you do not have access to a computer and a printer (I guess there are some people somewhere in the world who do not),I guess you're SOL.  The \"Advanced Guide\" is the essential one for using the amp, and is only 3 pages long. That's too short to explain everything you need to know in enough detail, and it's not particularly well-written. There'a another manual for using the free downloadable software that lets you edit the presets at a low level that is another 21 pages long.  I have not explored it much yet, but I suspect that it will be written similarly.  Once again, if you do not have a computer with an internet connection, there is a bunch of stuff that it is possible to do with the Spider IV 75 that you will not be able to do.My guess is that it would have probably added $150 to the list price of the amp for Line6 to have included a pedal and hard copies of the manual, and at $450, the amp would seem less attractive to many, so Line6 opted to handle things the way they did. Bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal.Very HIghly Recommended.JM Tepper", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Biggest bang for the guitar amp buck that there is", "unixReviewTime": 1340928000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2012"},

I had the boss looper with 2 pedals, and it was noisy on playback. That was years ago, and I couldn't get rid of it fast enough! I've used delay pedals my whole life, and being a fan of shoegaze/dream pop, I have always had a love of layered guitars/loops, a la the church or the chameleons, or chapterhouse, lush, house of love, and stuff.I looked on youtube and read reviews for a while before my purchase, as I don't have money to waste. This seemed to be the best choice for me. The use of this live, especially without the footswitch (sold seperately), would be tough to be sure. There are some stop and start moments, as to be the case with loopers. The only one I've seen that seems seamless is the boss one or roland one with like 5 pedals and is like 700 bucks maybe more. There are demos of a guy looping himself with different instruments all running into it. For the price, it should be and is great.This little wonder though, is fantastic. The price can't be beat, and it doesn't suck up tone as some of the other ones do from what I've read. The thing I would say is, it's best for recording, and to use as an audio notepad in a way.

As I had never so much as touched a ukulele before buying this one, I looked for a low-cost soprano to see whether I would enjoy playing such a similar looking but very different sounding and smaller instrument.Upon receiving this item, I tuned it up and had a little play using a few basic chords I learned. The Uke sounded acceptable, but I was (slightly) disappointed by the sound of the default supplied strings. Also at first (as I expected), the Ukelele went badly out of tune quickly when playing, but after a few hours the strings broke in and now keep their tuning with only occasional minor tweaks required.Of course, most cheap ukuleles come with fairly terrible (and cheap) strings so it would be wrong of me to be too critical when this instrument cost so little. I have now ordered some Aquila strings from Amazon to replace the default strings - i.e. I bought theAquila AQ-S Nylgut Soprano Ukulele Strings. I am still waiting for delivery on these, and will update this review when I eventually fit them as to the difference it makes, (which I expect will be a significant improvement in sound based upon my research.) To be honest though, the default strings on this ukulele aren't *too* bad so I may wait a while to install the Aquilla strings until I can play more competently and get the benefit of them!As far as the design and quality of this ukulele goes, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed. The paint-job was blemish free and well done, the unit appears to have been assembled well using adequate components, and the tuner backs on the reverse of the headstock are decorative little gold dolphins, which is a nice touch. The unit definitely belies its price and is a very nice looking instrument.For the money it costs, it is difficult to voice any serious gripes at all with this ukulele.

Essentially you are changing the scale length of the entire instrument when using this device.

This capo is great because it doesn't simply rely on a loaded spring to clamp down.  It has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob.  The reason this matters is because, depending on the guitar, sometimes a traditional loaded spring capo imparts too much spring tension (or not enough) when clamped.  Too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch.  Not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes.  Either one is not good.

Those seeking brutalzz should look elsewhere.  You can't blame a chicken for not quacking properly.

The build quality is decent for the price and it claims true bypass thought I haven't looked under the hood.

Truth be told, I kind of prefer my Behringer TO800 tonewise- more of a personal preferance in the way I prefer Pepsi to Coke but still drink both - but the TO800 pedal isn't true bypass and the build is much more flimsy on that one.

I thought that since I love Fender guitars and since he has a mini Squier we'd like to get something in the Fender Family.  I seriously expected a cheap imitation of a Line 6 Spider with a Fender logo slapped on it.  I should have had more faith in Fender.I am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp.  The AMP models are far more real and interesting sounding than any modeling tool I have ever used.  The amps don't sound digital or processed, they actually sound overdriven when you crank the gain.  You would swear that there are tubes in this thing when you listen to it.  I can't get over the Bassman, the twin Reverb and the Deluxe.  They sound so full and strong.My biggest compliment of the Mustang is that it is the ONLY modeling amp that has great sounding Vintage tones.  Line 6 has tons of metal stuff, and a lot of weird niche tones.  Vox has never really made great modeling stuff.  Digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible.If you play Blues, Rock, Classic Rock, Country, Funk etc... This amp is for you.  There is just enough metal or heavy sounds to have a few choices for Modern Metal, but Metalheads might be better off with the Line 6 stuff.The other great thing about this amp is how easy it is to tweak the tones using the amp controls.  By looking at the controls, you know right where you are and what you have to do to edit your sound.  You don't need to dive 5 levels deep into an LCD screen in order to make great sounding tweaks.But if you like to go deep, you'll love the Fender Fuse software.  It is easy to use and there are countless user submitted tones to help shape your sound.The fact that Fender not only included FUSE with this amp, but also the Ableton recording software that is also pretty user friendly and fully usable without having to pay to upgrade anything, is just frosting on the cake.I am a father of 4 who normally has to practice at night and being able to have an amp that can get quiet but still sound amazing, with the added features of a headphone jack and an AUX in, I can play whenever I want.  I am actually selling my nice Tube amp and using the Mustang as my only amp for now, and I feel like I am not missing out on any features or downgrading my sound at all.The value of this amp is amazing.  People will shell out 2-3x as much for a Line 6 modeler, but the vintage tones will not sound anywhere close to as good as the Fender tones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bought it for my Kid.

But when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium. On that scale, these strings would be above a literal medium. For me, the guitar is not an everyday instrument. I don't typically spend five hours a day with one, and sometimes go weeks without picking one up. But I do have periods where I will spend many hours a day playing and don't want something that will kill me.Medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me. Light and custom light are easier to play, but can make a higher end Martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line. For me, these light-medium are exactly where I want my strings to be.If you like Martin's medium, find them a bit much at times, but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones, you may find that these are a great choice. I don't feel I am missing anything compared to the Medium. If I had two identical guitars with new strings of each type, I would probably find differences in a side by side comparison. But without that, I don't think I'd notice the difference with normal listening. With the lighter varieties, that would be far from true.If Martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1% milk of strings, these light-medium would be the 2% that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great choice for Martin strings", "unixReviewTime": 1308614400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2011"},

The insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages. However, it's the attention to small construction details that I love.

Another factor is the strain reliefs at each end. Those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable, which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them.Overall each cable in this set is constructed to withstand frequent set-up and teardown, and is built to last.

Because of the return policy I took a chance and am not only glad I did, but am also thoroughly impressed with this hanger.First, I doubt if I could build one for anywhere near the price of this if I purchased the materials locally. Factor in that shipping (at the time of my purchase) is free and this is a no brainer.Installation is also a no bainer and made so by the mounting hardware that comes with the hanger.There is one concern you may have. If you have instruments with nitrocellulose finishes the protective rubber sleeves on the hanging fork may eat into those finishes. Personally, mine are being used to hang a cheap Squire Strat and J-bass, and an Epiphone Les Pail Junior II - instruments more decorative than functional. I am not saying the sleeves will ruin the finish, but merely raising that possibility to help you to make a purchase decision.The bottom line, though, is if you are hanging guitars that do not have a nitrocellulose finish these hangers are a bargain.

It was delivered yesterday, and the first thing I noticed was that the neck was loose, and the strings were easily an inch or more off the fret board. I looked to make sure it wasn't warped or cracked, and it wasn't.So I scoured the internet to find my problem, and most results said to tighten the metal rod in the banjo pot. So I took the resonator off, and found that it had an inch gap between the neck and the body, and naturally that scared me, but I tightened the metal rod, and it brought the neck down to the body, and brought the strings down to the perfect height.Now it's a very beautiful instrument, and it sounds pretty good too, Granted, It's not a Gold Tone or what have you, But it sounds at-least like a banjo that costs 2-3x this much. The only thing I would change is the tuning pegs, as they are made out of a cheap plastic, they don't feel like they will break any time soon though, I just prefer metal tuning pegs. (the part that holds the strings is still metal, I'm talking about the things your turn with your fingers to tune it is plastic)So, I'm debating on rating it 4 stars or 5 stars.. I'd rate it 4 because of the scare it gave me at first, but I think I'll rate it 5 stars because of it's looks, sound, and price. Yes, the reviews are right guys, don't be skeptical, But be warned that you may have to do a little TLC on it, as I did with the neck. No worries though, Now I'm learning my new favorite instrument.

I've made 100's of picks out of old credit cards, gift cards, club cards, plastic sheets, plastic packaging well you get the idea.  THis is fun and easy to do.  I have even sold the picks at garage sales (25 cents each).  My favorite cards to use are the iTunes gift cards (careful cause some of the iTunes cards are cardstock).  They most replicate a Fender Med. pick.  Most credit cards are a bit thicker (somewhere between a Fender Med. and Heavy).  THey work well also (the edges do come out a little rough but I use an old emery board to clean them up quickly and easily).  I use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results.  The best part is I am NEVER without a pick (even when people accidentally walk off with one.)  I do get funny looks at the stores when I ask for the used gift cards back (until I explain what I do with them- then the clerks are like &#34;wow thats so cool&#34;).  On average I can get 5 picks from a credit card (unless I'm going for a particular part of the card with a design on it).  It takes a little thought to get the most out of the cards- but seeing as they are basically free I don't mind &#34;wasting&#34; parts if I want a particular image.

If you are using a powered microphone you get a crazy loud buzzing, and interference when the monitor, and microphones are plugged in.

To be honest, I was very, very impressed with their feel and handling. I do think they're the best playing strings I've used when it comes to pure playability. Hands down, none better. They were butter-smooth and great for flat picking. But for me it was a trade-off, because I simply wasn't impressed with the tone. I even took the time to try them on three different guitars (all dreadnoughts): a classic maple sides/spruce top, a mahogany back/sides with spruce top, and a maple backs/sides with a nato top. On all three, I didn't like the tone as much as the strings I was using. I really wanted to like them, but they simply didn't have the tone of the medium gauge Martin SPs I normally use.This isn't to say they're not great strings that sound different on other peoples' guitars, but I simply didn't like them on mine. I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam group. The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use, and the treble sounds tinny vs. the clear ring of the Martins I normally use. To be fair, the bass strings sound great, and aren't much different. I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you're going to use them. I play in acoustic groups, and the Elixir strings just don't have what I need to be heard, in spite of how great they feel under your fingers. If playability is more important than great tonal range, then by all means buy these strings...you won't be disappointed.

So why only three stars? Well, these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find. These are stiff, thick, and heavy. While that's good for most analog cables, these cables are so stiff and heavy that, for instance, a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there.With so many amps having plastic jacks these days, you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard-mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one. I mean, let's face it. You never know what will happen at a gig. Sometimes you're playing with a 12 foot cable when you should have a 18 foot cable. A cable shouldn't come out because of a gentle pull, but if it's between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it, you want the cable to fall out. If everything you have is heavy or Velcro'd to the ground, this isn't a problem, but it is for me. I feel like when you're playing with these cables, you're worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out, but because it's seriously like a trip wire out there.Lastly, these plugs are huge. That's not really a problem if you play a Strat or a Tele, but what about a P-Bass or a J-Bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body? This is going to stick out a lot, and to loop it around your strap, it's going to be a huge, stiff, cumbersome loop. I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for those kinds of instruments, but most normal straight plugs do just fine. So yeah, if you like to move around on stage, get more flexible cables. You'll thank me.These cables are just poorly thought out. They'd work great as patch cords, or keyboards, drum machines, from pedal board to amp (as long as you have a metal jack).

Now, I'm definitely not one of those who automatically dismiss the quality of Chinese made products. I have, in fact, many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there. This item however has some of the good, AND some of the more stereotypical problems of Chinese goods. Pros: Cheap. Sturdy. And unlike some reviewers, I love the taller height. Far far better for you ergonomically not having to stoop and scrunch your neck and windpipe. I also like the tighter springs, though that does take a little getting used to. But the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort. Now, the Cons: It's true what others have said: the plastic neck tube smells. Not as bad as some have said, but an annoying chemical smell is definitely noticeable. I cut that off and got a big wide replacement tube at TAP Plastics for a buck (make sure the one you get is wide enough to slide over the bends in the neck loop bar thingee - I got the 1/2\" diameter). 2nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is NOT bent evenly. Mine was distinctly taller on one side than the other, and the neck loop was WAY off. I did my best to bend all parts to even, but the flat metal part is tough to shape. The reason I didn't return it is that I figure most of them are equally uneven: I just picture a bunch of poor souls slaving away bending these suckers by hand, with little or no machine help to ensure consistency. With the work I did on it myself, it works fine and is now fairly even, and like I said, the taller height is just about right for me. It's just annoying that some of the most basic expectations aren't met (like holding your harmonica at an even height on both sides). All this said, the bottom line is that I prefer using this OVER my German made Hohner holder because it's better ergonomically (taller), holds my harp more securely, and the traditional dual butterfly nut design just works far better and with less effort than the \"nouveau\" single butterfly nut design of my more expensive German Hohner.

It's low wattage guarantees crushing tube overdrive and classic British tones in the palm of your hand.WHY ONLY 3 STARS? For starters, this is what I would consider a \"novelty-boutique amplifier\", because it recreates vintage British sounds like a boss, but it's lack of clean headroom is evident. It's an Orange after all, and so if you want a dirty Plexi sound with only 1-channel to work with - this head is for you. Playing with a Les Paul, I tested it through a Marshall 1960A 4x12 and it sounds amazing. I also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a Celestion G12H30. I was able to find the \"sweet spot\" on the Tone knob, which for me was around 1 o'clock, and with the Volume at noon and the Drive at max... I had entered a very musical, lush, and totally gig-worthy tone zone that Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young, and Jimmy Page would have loved to go on tour with. However, as much as I love eating British Crunch for breakfast, I consider myself a versatile player who needs a bright and heady clean channel AND that classic punch'n'crunch we all know and love AND a solid distortion for metal and beyond. Unfortunately, the Micro Terror is a ONE TRICK PONY in the Tone category, and for this (if we're starting at 5 stars) I have to subtract one star. I feel confident subtracting a star for tone because the Micro Terror doesn't exactly take pedals well either without generating too much noise, which leads to feedback. I subtract another star because this head is really only usable if you're in a rock band, already own a 2x12 or 4x12, and want something quick and small to use to rock out with. The problem is, if you're one of those people, you probably already have a solid amp head to drive that 2x12 or 4x12 in the first place. This puts the Micro Terror into Secondary status or useful as an emergency head during a gig if things take a turn for the worse. This leads me to my final point: if the intent is to purchase this as a bedroom practice or garage rehearsal head, then for the price you could get a much better product that has two GOOD channels instead of one simple (but GREAT) one.WHAT I LOVE about the Micro Terror is that it is something you can always keep in your arsenal. Having owned several different combo amps and head/cabinet variations over the years, the Micro Terror could fill that niche because it can be scaled according to your performance or rehearsal needs. If I were starting over from scratch, I'd probably buy two 2x12 cabs, a Micro Terror, and a bigger and more powerful tube head to drive both cabs if needed. This would give you perfect flexibility for band rehearsal, studio recording, small bar, big bar, club, or concert stage venues.(TO THOSE WHO THINK THIS REVIEW WAS UNHELPFUL: I've noticed this review, and pretty much any review of this amp with anything bad to say about it is getting unhelpful votes. It seems like, people want this to be a 5-Star Amp but always with the caveat of \"but it's $150, what do you expect?\" or they begin their rave review with \"For a $150 amp...\". Look, I don't judge gear just by price, I judge it by VALUE and with my EARS first. The reality is, you need a really nice 1x12, 2x12, or 4x12 to really make the Micro Terror sound amazing. If you're dropping $150 for the Terror, and probably another $150~$250 for a great cab... why not spend that $300 or so on a great ALL-tube 1x12 to begin with with 2 channels, better EQ, and the option to route to an external cab from the get-go?)", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Agent Orange", "unixReviewTime": 1386547200, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2013"},

Swanson", "helpful": [6, 9], "reviewText": "After all these reviews I expected the Greatest Strings Ever, golden strands of Glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection!Instead, I got a decent set of .10's that lasted a whole hour before the D snapped at the neck pickup. I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I pre-stretch them gently but completely. Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons, so I break very few of my normal strings, Slinky .10's. Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension, tuned down, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings.As for the tone, it's definitely bright and almost too edgy, but nicely zingy all told. Yet one negative I've noticed after about 8 hours' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making them harder to tune. Sounds odd, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles ain't cheap either at triple the price, please note), I've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings.So, I must say I'm summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric strings.What's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast?Especially when it costs three times more?And what's up with the tuning thing?And why do these cost so much more, anyhow? Is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string? Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes, zero doubt there.Anyhow, I've got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now, so as they age I'll get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while. And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs, tonally. So much for Magic Elixir Tone.Don't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control?If I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality? Or heck, even just a little better...PS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions. I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questions.[Edit: And now, after only six hours' of playing on that guitar, the B string popped at the same place as the D, neck pickup. Once again I ask: what good are strings that \"sound good three times longer\" if they break three times faster?][Edit: 10/31/12. Come on! After four more hours, the A string went. I only play that ax one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, \"Which one will go today?\" He said he's amazed the G is still on, as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension. An hour later, guess what? Yep. So that's four broken strings in less than 20 hours' play. Seriously?Not only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks, I'd be bummed if they cost 3 bucks. The only plus I can think of at this point is they sounded good when new, but dang, unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such, I'd stick with Slinkies or D'Addarios. Unless I got a \"bad set\", which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price. In any case, these Elixirs were just not worth the money.][Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple breakage, and they sent me another set. That set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet, thought the tuning issue remains. I'll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud.

I love the idea, but usually I feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired.  But when this popped up on my Vine newsletter I thought I'd give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things I don't like about the other ones (*COUGH*snark*COUGH*).A little background first, I guess.  I've been playing guitar for the last 9 years, and I currently have two other tuners.  I have a little Korg plug in type,  where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up.  I also have a Boss TU-3 pedal tuner.  If I'm jamming with friends or playing a show, the TU-3 is what I'll use to stay in tune.  Its very durable and accurate, and I like how I can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal, so I can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and/or the audience.  For home practice I use the Korg, as I usually tune up before I start playing, then just plug into my practice amp and blast away.  The Korg is nice and accurate, easy enough to use for alternate tunings, and in 9 years of having it around (including in and out of jam sessions before buying the TU-3) I've only had to buy one replacement.I first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue Snark that everyone seems to have these days.  He was not incredibly pleased with it.  Not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock, it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn't exatly easy to tune up with it.  While I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool, it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something I'd want on my headstock.Enter this Mini Headstock Tuner by Planet Waves.  Does it fix the problems that made the Snark so unappealing to my friend and me?1.  Accuracy:  It does seem to tune accurately, that's a good thing, and it already puts this ahead of the Snark.  Its not easy to use for alternate tunings however, so do keep that in mind.  Also, the letters take some getting used to, as they use that kind of chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players.  Not a huge complaint, but it isn't as idiot proof as my Korg or TU-3.2.  Looks/Ease Of Use:  It's quite a bit more subtle than the Snark, able to hide behind your headstock, which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar.  The only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a Les Paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side, you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen.  My LP copy has the larger Grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock.  I wear my guitar fairly low, so I was able find an area where I can see it from the top down, but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck.  Those with Fender style headstocks should have no problem, though, it'll work great for them.  Also, it is plenty bright, so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue.3.  Durability:  This is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are.  The Snark is very easy to break, as it rests on a small ball joint.  This Planet Waves mini isn't going to lose its head too easy, but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold up under too much use.  The tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too, so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it would be easy enough to break.  I haven't had it long enough for this to happen yet, so I can only give you my initial impressions.  Let's just say this, I'd never gig with this guy as my only tuner.  Its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use.All in all, it is a better headstock choice than the Snark.  However, headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they're gonna work for everyone.  Anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest a Boss TU-2 or TU-3 or a Korg Pitchblack).  I know they're more expensive, but you'll be happier off in the long run.  Those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session, this is a nice option.  But it may not hold up forever.I'll probably stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug in, but as headstock tuners go, this is nicer than most.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Its good for what it is, but they're not great yet...", "unixReviewTime": 1319587200, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2011"},

The tuning issues others have mentioned relative to break in periods are no different from what you would expect on violins or guitars, and are perfectly normal.Although this plays well, I was disappointed with the workmanship.

But the workmanship is somewhere closer to the level of lower quality instruments I've seen of other types.The finishing quality is not out of line for the price range, but does not approach what other reviewers have led me to believe. The wood is not properly finished where the neck meets the body, and there are clear sanding marks in the wrong direction. It looks as if it had been finished in a hurry by somebody who had no intention of doing a quality job.A less important issue has to do with the grain. Normally, instrument makers will try to line up the grain with the direction of the body. On mine, the grain is at a slant, giving the impression that the neck is slightly bent. It's an optical illusion, but not a sign of higher quality instrument making.The workmanship issues are cosmetic, and I'm still quite satisfied with the way the instrument plays. The finishing issues will not be visible when being played, and the tonal quality is about what I'd expect from an instrument with such a small resonating chamber.

It has a nice full sound and does not take steel fingers to make acceptable sounds.  The tone is very rich and will having even simple chords sounding great.  The fit and finish of the piece is amazing for the price. It looks great and had no rough or unfinished areas.  The frets are smooth and finished and the fingerboard feels good.

From simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all!  The only real compliant I had (and the reason for the 4 stars) is the stock strings aren't the best (IMHO) for a beginner.  I'm pretty sure they use heavy strings as stock and sure they produce a nice deep rich sound, and WON'T break, they are BRUTAL on new fingers!  I would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on.  The only other minor quibble is the bridge seems a bit light duty and their is a tendency to get some string slap on the lower strings.

At less than $15, you need to be able to look past these things.  I've had a higher failure rate with the Dunlop Cry Baby and that thing is built like a cinder block.  This pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended. Which is to say, this pedal does a nice job in overdriving the preamp tubes in your valve amplifier.  No brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going.  No overdrive pedal lives up to it's potential running into a solid state (even modeling) amplifier.  It's just not what they are really intended to do and they end up sounding buzzy. Some have complained about RF interference with the use of the FAB pedals (getting radio signals through your amp).  I have had that happen with pedals costing 5x the price of the FAB- particularly when running a long pedal chain.  Based on tone alone, this pedal can overdrive your tube preamp as well as most anything out there under $100.  Check out the YouTube review of this pedal by a guy that goes by 'intheblues'.  I believe he uses a DRRI with a strat, and this pedal sounds GREAT.  If you did a blind test between this pedal and an overdrive costing north of $100 you may be surprised- particularly if your other gear (amp and guitar) are halfway decent.  What I did note though, was that this pedal has a wee bit more gain and a little less treble than my other TS type pedals.  That doesn't make it worse or better- just different.  The 'mid-hump' is actually less pronounced than in a tubescreamer, which is a good thing IMHO.  There are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market!  It will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers.  Incidentally, the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes.  Since it isn't true bypass, you will likely get some tone suck if you run a bunch of these in your chain, but if the rest of your pedals have decent bypass you will be fine.  Lest you mistake me for a novice fanboy with no point of reference for my review- I've been playing guitar since 1979 and have used 'vintage' dirt boxes since before they were vintage and overpriced.

It feels very soft to the touch and it is made in Korea. There is a small warning on theback of the package that states: \"Not designed for cleaning electrical devices.\" You can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water, rinse it out and hang it up to dry. Now to thereview.My guitar has an Ebony hard lacquer finish, meaning very glossy and shiny. I have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body's front and back and BACKof the neck. I was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off. When going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish.What I discovered about this cloth, even with increased elbow grease, is that it has it's limitations.So, if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out. If the body oils have been there for awhile, probably collecting dust, then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument. Pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument. Do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument. You should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it.I decided to use Dunlop's 'Dunlop Formula 65 Guitar Polish & Cleaner' to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges. I used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely. Since then I have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the 'Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth'. It doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid. I also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind.You want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish.The fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play. I would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated  on the fret board will get into the Microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar.So like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything. I gave this untreated microfiber cloth4 stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean  and polished with minimal effort. My highexpectations, based upon the blurb, were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around. It was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess.Nonetheless, I like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime.

Overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be.  I run a Randall G3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state I've used or heard.  For recording I use a Peavey 5150 and its so sweet.  Tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.Recently I started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that I felt like could only be achieved through a pedal.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, I used the DOD death metal for years when I first started playing.  However, there is a downside.  Go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old AM radio, if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250.  Quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.I chose the MT-2 because I know Boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using.  It gives a variety of sounds.  It can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones.  The controls make it very tweakable and I have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it.  Read the included book, look up some MP3s over videos online and check out other guitarists' settings.  It will help you tame this pedal into what you want.  Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot.  There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.I've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz.  I must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig.  Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT-2.  I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response.I say the MT-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal.

I CAN tell a slight difference. I did not remove the strings, just loosened them so it was compared to the set that was on it, which were fresh from yesterday.A small amount of improvement in sustain and high end frequencies ringing out was noticeable.They also provide a graph in the packaging info, but I think that it was a test using BOTH the TUSQ pins AND replacement saddle. If you haven't changed your saddle...do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one.I must admit, I did order these with about 75% of \"dressing up\" the guitar in mind, and any amount of tonal improvement would be gladly appreciated but not expected. I got both.White with Paua Dot inlay looks very nice and provides the eye candy I was seeking, although there is no care taken as to \"match the dots\" for consistency, -they will vary in appearance.The TUSQ Pins being a wee bit smaller seem to slide down all the way...right away and need to be pushed all the way into the slot while stringing up the guitar. The heads set flush to the bridge mount compared to the Gibson stock plastic pins that stick up a little higher, and I do wish that the TUSQ pins were the same size.I will see how well they do on the Blues King and most likely will order new pins for the Songwriter Deluxe once they pass the test of time and playing for a month or two. I don't expect them to cause any problems and should provide the extra sustain and ringing that is very much appreciated in any small amount or fashion!If in doubt, consider changing your strings to a brand that might be more suited for the \"tone\" you have in mind, be it darker, brighter, softer, louder, etc. Strings make a big difference and I find using D'Addario phosphor bronze strings very bright & ringy, last long, are affordable, and seem noticeably louder than GHS or Ernie Ball. (steel strings only - does not apply to nylon or gut strings.)Once again, if you have a plastic saddle and/or nut then these pins might not make much of a noticeable difference...then again, they might make all the difference in the world!

It is just an on/off switch, so no half modeling here,The only reason I gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5 is because Yamaha decided not to include a polarity switch and alienate perhaps 20% of the market who will get home and , if they hadn't thought to check, may be stuck wi a pedal that sustains when not being used and stops sustaining when pressed.  A backward sustain pedal is not fun.  Many manufacturers include a simple polarity reverse  switch that would eliminate that potential headache.These days, most keyboards have the option to switch polarity internally either thru a global bemusement or by sensing whether the pedal is engaged at startup and adjusting accordingly (never press the sustain pedal while turning your keyboard on, you may very well cause an issue you don't expect and are confused by - turning on and off again without the pedal depressed will clear everything up in those cases.)So - build quality, excellent.  Durability - excellent (I've had a bunch of cheaper pedals - used on stage - break  at the switch point or at the jack), this Yamaha endures.  Design - some older pedals used to have a flip out rubber footrest that was supposed to make the pedal more secure- I don't see that much anymore, but, so long as you aren't on glossy hardwood, this will stay I place with no issue.I've read a few reviews that give this pedal a bad rating because of what appears to be a change in a global setting on a keyboard, or something similar,  All a sustain pedal consist of is a momentary contact switch, engaged when contact is made by depressing and completing the circuit, and disengaged when the pedal is released.  There are no electronics - so - if it doesn't work, there are three points to look at 1) unscrew the jack and be sure that the wires coming from the pedal are all  connected to the metal posts inside the housing. There are usually two wires of differing color.  if one is disconnected, the pedal will cease to function (and, in rare instances, cause the keyboard to sustain all notes indefinitely.  This is easily corrected with a soldering iron and a bit if solder - jacks are points of strain so it isn't inconceivable that a wire could come disconnected. 2) The switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged.  The switches in the Yamaha pedals are of good quality and unless you received a faulty part, would be unlikely to wear out with normal use. I have, however, needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment.  this was easy and a quick fix, even with limited tools.  The third option is 3) the keyboard has had a change in a global setting causing the pedal t operate in reverse.  This can be corrected by consulting your owners manual and reading whether your keyboard has a software polarity &#34;switch&#34;, if it senses on startup, or if you pedal simply stopped working altogether - doing nothing At all - it is #1 or 2 or a problem with the jack on the keyboard (HIGHLY unlikely,,but I've seen it happen.). Hopefully this helps some who have posted questions.To conclude - a nice pedal for the money, much better build than the m-audio (decent, just not as nice as the Yamaha - certainly not a bad unit)/on stage (if they can't get most of their mic stands right, I don't trust them with even basic electronics...) or generics.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Heavy duty, well constructed single tongue pedal.", "unixReviewTime": 1378080000, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2013"},

If you buy EZ Drummer 1.0 from now until then, you will ALSO get the download for 2.0. Bear in mind, EZD2 is a completely new/different program from EZD1, and so I would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock EZD1 Pop/Rock Kit (which has some very kit pieces) in addition to the EZD2 default kit (which is more reminiscent of the ROCK! expansion kit from what I've seen). EZ Drummer 2.0 also gives you the ability to mix/mash kit pieces from all expansions, and so to me this makes EZ Drummer a MUST BUY based on the sheer customization available. ***RESUME NORMAL PROGRAMMING***If you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit, EZDrummer is probably the best bang for the buck you'll find. It's very easy to use, very easy to program, and overall a well made product. You might be tempted to compare EZDrummer to its bigger and better brother: Superior Drummer 2.0, made by the same company. Superior Drummer is superior to EZDrummer, but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact close-to-life sounding virtual instrument.There are ways to improve the off-the-shelf sound quality of EZDrummer immediately. YouTube has plenty of video tutorials on this, but what you want to do is open up your Digital Audio Workstation (Pro Tools, Cubase, etc), and set EZDrummer for multi-track output. From there you'll be able to tweak the different outputs EZDrummer has as if you were in a studio and had 7 mics at your disposal. Most high-end professional studios use about 10 mics to capture everything on a drum kit, and so 7 virtual mics is nothing to scoff at: Kick Drum, Snare Top and Bottom, Toms, Cymbals, Overhead, and Room. Once you have each of those outputs running, you can perform individual EQs to change the tone dramatically. Adding a touch of distortion/gain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound REALLY close-to-life. In reality, once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced, it only takes a trained ear to tell that it's a virtual kit.As far as the expansions go, if you are looking to record a particular style of music, then I highly recommend buying the EZX kit that goes with that genre. The stock Rock kit is VERY GOOD (after performing the mods above)... but only for Rock. As for me personally, I did my best to EQ and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone, but in the end, I found the Rock kit lacking, especially since it's a \"tight\" kit (3 toms, 3 cymbals, 1 hi-hat, 1 snare, 1 kick).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "EZ, breezy, beautiful, drummer girl.", "unixReviewTime": 1381708800, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2013"},

But for what they cost they certainly are more than I expected.  I give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even taking the low cost into consideration.  They are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $5 for sure. I bought one Behringer XM8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go.  However, we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech's personal SM-58's are busy at another job.  I honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the Behringers.  At one time Alice Cooper and his band were using the Behringer XM8500's, however they may have moved on now for all I know.These are not Shure SM-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs.  They have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the Shure's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq'ed correctly.  They are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq.  It also is if anything more versatile than the SM-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an SM-57 to pick up.  It doesn't overload easily, has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the SM-58.  It has a reasonably decent blast filter, so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don't have to add a windscreen.  Another strength of these is durability.  My 3 have sustained numerous drops, a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall.  No damage at all to any of them!  I used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now I just shrug. One weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise, but on the stand handling noise is no issue.  Mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters.  The stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable. If you want SM-58's you need to buy SM-58's.  If you want a good all around microphone in the $20 to $40 class then try one of these.  No on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the SM-58's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability!  I don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price.

They are a wonderful innovation and certainly easier to use than the older rectangular chromatic tuners that do not attach to the instrument. One of my favorites has become the Planet Waves clip on. I have several of them and use them often on many guitars. Based on this experience, I was anticipating a better experience with this new Mini Headstock Tuner than I wound up getting.It tunes nicely and, so far as my ear is concerned, accurately. Others found it awkward to attach - I did not. It is small and unobtrusive but easy to read. Those are not problems. What is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device.This fragility is conspicuous in both the difficulty in removing the battery cover and, more importantly, in the too-delicate manual clamp used to fasten it onto an instrument.The fundamental issue is that in lieu of the spring clips that we used to attach other versions of the Planet Waves tuners to the guitars, this one has a basic manual expand and contract clamp. This clamp is made out of thin plastic, is difficult to adjust and I expect it to break after only a short time. Consequently, I cannot recommend this tuner if the user needs to be moving it from one instrument to the other.If the need is for a tuner that attaches to ONE instrument and will, essentially, live there, it is nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible to all but the player. If you need to move the tuner from instrument to instrument, you would be well advised to spend a few more dollars and stick with the clip-on versions of Planet Waves tuners.November 28,2011 UPDATEHaving used this tuner for a while now, I have found that it has a good purpose. While this tuned does have mobility issues as I initially noted, I have been surprised (and pleased)to realize that they are wonderful 'permanent' tuners for acoustic guitars! They are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible. I leave them on my 12-strings and one of the 6's. A non-built-in-built-in tuner at this price cannot be beat.

What I can say is that it has put up with a lot of use, no problem with the pedal itself, mechanically. However, the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product. That is to say, the rubber feet began to come off in no time. If you mount it on a pedal board, you will probably remove those feet and this won't be a problem. Also, the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal. If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable, at least on my unit, the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. Those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat. What I have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push ALL THE WAY in, otherwaise, ZAP. Other than those two issues, the power issue really no fault of Dunlop's if you use the supplied power cable, its been a great pedal.

As banged up as a Manhasset can get from week-end warriors like me who simply throw it on top of everything else in the backseat before the long ride home, I've never had one fail on me over the past 40+ years.  There's nothing on the stand that the user can even adjust, yet all of the moving parts always seem to retain just the right amount of tension, preventing 5-10 pound folders from lowering the top half or causing it to dip forward.  But the \"rub\" is their non-adaptability.  The feet on the base are permanently attached as is the upper tray holding the music.  Consequently, these ubiquitous, well-proven stands can sometimes be a challenge to pack in a crowded van or sedan, especially with a couple of keyboards, amps, instrument stands, and other requisite gear on board.This is where Amazon's On-Stage Music Stand becomes attractive (of course, it doesn't hurt that it costs less than a Manhasset).  It permits you to fold up the legs to a position parallel with the shaft as well as to completely remove the upper shelf that holds the music.  Consequently, it's much easier to find a convenient place--whether in the trunk or on the floor of the back seat--for packing the stand.  Simply \"slide\" it into position.The drawback--apart from durability issues that some reviewers have warned about (be careful not to over-tighten those set-screws!)--is that this thing is heavy.  Frankly, I was expecting a lightweight stand, at least compared to my old Manhasset, but if you've owned or been around the latter, the first thing you're likely to notice with the stand pictured here is a palpable, substantial addition in weight. At the same time, with the moving parts and the set screws (topped by plastic, rotating, serrated wheels), the On-Stage stand doesn't give me the same amount of confidence in its durability as did the Manhasset--in other words, I'm very less likely to become careless with it and simply toss it on top of the gear-pile after a long, exhausting 4-hour gig.Bottom line: the On-Stage appears to be a good value--a truly heavy-duty stand (in most respects) that'll do extremely well as a practice stand in a studio or living room and that packs up conveniently for traveling jobs.  But don't expect it to lighten your load or, simply because it's heavier, to last longer than a Manhasset.If you do a lot of traveling and don't plan to put one of those 1000-page piano folders on the stand, there's at least one truly lightweight (albeit plastic) stand that's worked out really well for me (perhaps needless to say, some haven't--they fall apart or they're so ingeniously designed that it takes 15 minutes simply to disassemble them and put them back in their unforgiving, pint-sized cases).  But the Peak stand is made to hold up (in turn, it holds up relatively heavy music books) and has served me well for several years (just as I was about to condemn the stand, I called the company, they responded immediately by sending out a critical plastic piece that had become warped, and the Peak stand has been problem-free ever since).  It'll cost you a bit more, but not as much as some folks are willing to spend in exchange for losing a few unwanted pounds.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A trade-off, but possibly a better traveling companion.", "unixReviewTime": 1294185600, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2011"},

I bought it mainly to use with my (non-pedal) steel guitar. On a pedal steel you can bend notes with the pedals and levers, and most steel players use a volume pedal to do swells. However, I play standing up and manipulating the volume pedal was difficult to control because of balancing on one foot and the sensitivity of some of the pedals.This pedal gives a simulation of the volume swells that give steel guitar that distinctive sound. It's sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works. Since the steel is always being played by picking the individual strings (no chording), this pedal works along with that technique. I combine it with a sustainer to make the swells extend a little, and it gives a fair approximation of using a volume pedal to swell the notes.I tried this with regular guitar, but it's not the same. For chords, it does add an effect, but it's not very distinctive, and for single notes, it would depend on the song.

(Samson is maker of the highly popular and effective Zoom personal digital recorders--the H2 and the H4n.)  It's an attractive, fully outfitted piece of equipment, with handsome packaging (a small black box and zippered carrying case with aesthetics apparently inspired by iPod).  It's smaller and lighter than the Snowflake--more diminutive than the picture would suggest.  Yet the audio quality strikes me as being somewhat warmer and richer, favoring the bass frequencies of spoken narration more than the Snowflake, which has slightly cleaner and clearer definition at the treble end.The Samson Go was seen instantly by my iMac, and recording was as advertised: \"Plug n' Play.\"  The mic is somewhat more sophisticated than the Snowflake in terms of \"latency\" settings (it permits direct monitoring via headphones connected to the mic to insure no delay, or lag time, between transmission and reception), and there's a three-way switch for directional patterns (the manual could be clearer, however, about the difference between \"cardioid\" and \"cardioid 10 pad.\")  No matter. The mic performed virtually flawlessly right out of the box, with no tampering with the switch.It's extremely sensitive, slightly more so than the Snowflake.  Yet I was unable to avoid the \"P\" popping sounds, regardless of how close I got to the mic and muted my consonants.  So be prepared for the addition of some sort of \"pop filter\" device (either one sold on Amazon or a self-designed one, using a nylon stocking).The mic can be clipped to the top of a computer screen or mounted on a mic stand (using a supplied adapter or ordering a properly sized one from Samson).  Yet with its heavy base plus the flexible, tilting mic, it can be placed on a flat surface--much like the Snowflake, but with greater stability and without any intrusive cable.  (The Snowflake tends to \"flop around,\" requiring some balancing of the device by the user.)My biggest disappointment thus far is that the clip, as alluded to by another reviewer, does not open far enough for attachment to a desk-top computer (it should be an ideal fit with most notebook machines).  Although the Snowflake doesn't use a spring clip, it suffers from the same limitation.  If you're especially concerned about durability, the Snowflake appears to be the heavier, more rugged mic, with thick metal and no tiny switches or spring clips to wear out.  The Samson is the more delicate and refined of the two.  But don't kid yourself.  Either mic will exceed the capabilities of your computer's built-in mic and perhaps the owner's expectations. On the other hand, neither is a match for the Shure SM7B that I'm accustomed to using at a local broadcasting studio.  Still, Samson would appear to have a winner with this little wonder, whether it's used in conjunction with a computer to record full-frequencied music or \"realistic\"-sounding narration.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Strong competitor to Blue's Snowflake", "unixReviewTime": 1256083200, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2009"},

I strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar. Every time I got the higher strings in tune, the lowers would go down as much as a half note. It took awhile to realize that my floating bridge was coming off the body as I tightened the strings. So I pulled the back plate off my strat and set to off tighten down the the tensions screws. I made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress. The final time I tightened them down, the high E string broke. Since these were my only beefy's, my day was done with these strings.

The tuner seems to be reasonably accurate, is lightweight, and is easy to read without being obtrusive to the audience.  It is also nice that such an inexpensive and small tuner can be adjusted to standards on either side of A-440.  Note that the photo of the tuner shows it on the headstock of a Fender-style electric guitar.  It works particularly well on the instrument shown because of the fact that the tuners are all on the same side of the headstock.  On something like a Gibson jazz guitar (ES-175, or one of the Epiphone or Ibanez clones, for example) it's more difficult to find an ideal place to attach the tuner.  Classical and acoustic steel-string guitars are also a tad problematic, too.  It's not that this tuner is unusable on other types of headstocks, it's just that the design limits where you can place it and still have it readable right-side up.  Some headstocks, too, may be too thick in order to attach this tuner.

And like everyone else I wound up with a few of my own. Here is what I have learned during the four or so years I have owned and used this model:- For the money they are a bargain and work extremely well in home studios and practice spaces (assuming the areas are not overly cramped.)- They hold up under light gigging and jamming, meaning they are not transported more than two or three days a week.- Good stability inside, even with heavier microphones like theBlue Microphones enCORE 100 Studio-Grade Dynamic Performance Microphone. Not so good outside if there is a fair breeze.I lost one to stepping inadvertently on one of feet, which immediately broke, and another has started binding when I try to extend or collapse the center pole. Those problems are not necessarily quality issues since in the case of the broken tripod it was my fault and not the gear's. As for the binding - I am sure that a good amount of grime has found its way into the tube after four years of use and transporting the stands. Had I taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented.For inexpensive stands these are hard to beat. However, I now use theSeismic Audio - Tripod Microphone Mic Boom Stand - PA/DJ/Band/Church/Wedding use, which I consider to be a superior stand for a small increase in price. Also, for outside use or when stage real estate is an issue I have found the old school styleOn Stage MC7201B Round Base Microphone Stand, Blackto be a far better solution.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid for light use", "unixReviewTime": 1338940800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2012"},

So much more discreet to do a little last minute tune up when you're already on the stage.I love that the lights are bright and easy to see, unlike one previous tuner I had that was very hard to read. Dark grey letters on a light grey screen. Even better is that the light colors are different for flat, sharp and on-tune which makes it even easier. May not seem like a big deal when you're tuning alone at your house, but when you're on a stage with other people doing a lot of last minute adjustments and your attention is all over the place, those little details really help.The only real drawback I see in the design is that there is no place on the head of my 6 string acoustic where I can conveniently clip this without it being somewhat in the way of the tuning knobs. Not impossible, but not terribly convenient, either. It was seemingly designed with an electric style in mind where the knobs are more often in one straight line than on either side of the guitar head.The $80 tuner I bought 20 years ago is a Sabine, and quite frankly, 20 years later it still works as well as it did when I bought it. In fact, the price has come down and I bought another one to keep in a different guitar case. Now that I have this one I still use the Sabine more at home, but like this one better on stage because it's low profile.

Garcia \"Biggie-E\"", "helpful": [27, 34], "reviewText": "I'll start off by saying that I'm a proud owner of:- Gibson ES125 Acoustic/Electric- Pono MSD-E- Blackheart BH5H- Blackheart BH110- A Weber Vintage Series 10A125 (10 inch, 8 ohm, 30 watts) in an open back, solid pine cabinet- A Jensen Mod 10-50 (10 inch, 4ohm, 50 watts)- All tube Fender Tweed ChampNow that you know the gear I have, what I can play through an amp, and what I can plug an amp head into, I'll sum up my review with this:What you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab, the cables you use, and how clean your power is. Got good gear?  This little amp will sound great.The DetailsThe amp itself is tiny.  I have an Electro-Harmonix pedal that's bigger than this amp! Still, it packs a punch.  With the gain at about 1/3 up and the volume at half, I get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue.  Crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go.  Yes, this little amp will go from Jazz & Country to Rock & Metal with a twist of a dial.The line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have.  If you want to quietly play along with some tunes, you can.  Practice time just got better for your neighbors.The one lone tube in the Micro Terror is the pre-amp tube.  Mine came stock with a JJ Tubes 12AX7.  I understand that's standard.  A JJ is nice, but it will *not* warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone.  Dig out an old Phillips, RCA, Sylvania, or GE to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother.  I had an old GE made in Great Britain lying around and popped it in my Micro Terror: warmed it right up; cleaned up a bunch of high-end tinniness.Still, compared to my two-tube BH5H or my all tube Champ, this guy does sound more solid state than anything.  BUT, compared to a buddy's Roland and solid state Ampeg, it's downright mellow.No effects loop means that your time-based effects (reverb, echo, chorus) can get noisy. So, if you like pedals, stock up on 9 volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in.Speaking of power adapters: a previous reviewer is right.  The external power brick for this guy seems fragile.  I'm not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp. It's holding up, but one round with my cat and I'll be looking for a new power supply.The RubAnnoyance #1:  One cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying HISS even at low volumes.  I found that out quickly.  So, get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp.  I'm running it with a GLS 12 gauge speaker cable and a Planet Waves American Stage instrument cable - both available here at Amazon or any good guitar shop.Annoyance #2:  This is a 20 watt amp, right?  WELL... if you don't run a 4ohm speaker, you won't get all 20 watts.  The Micro Terror self-adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output. (Yes yes... don't quote physics to me.)  At 8ohms, I still get good volume.  But at 16ohms (like my BH110) it sounds like a 5 or 7 watt amp.  That said, I'm actually a fan of the tone I get with my 8ohm Weber in its pine cab. The 8 inch Jensen speaker in my Champ, while nice, can't put out the low notes like I'd prefer and the Jensen Mod 10-50 is TOO clean.  But the Weber 10A125 sounds fantastic to my ears; even with the loss in volume.Annoyance #3: The Micro Terror is so small and so light, it'll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord.  Unlike a nice 20 pound amp, the chord won't pull out.  So: BE CAREFUL.Mitigation for Annoyance #3: The all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors... though, it will gouge your floor.And then there's the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier: if the power is noisy or ungrounded, you will wind up with hiss no matter what.  I always carry a Monster HTS 350 and run my amp through it; that REALLY helps in cleaning up signal noise.  (If you don't have one, get one.  The 300 & 350 are cheap and they work.)The SummaryAfter all that, I can still say:  I love this little amp!  I've gigged with it and it sings well.  Plus, the added gag of tiny ukulele + tiny amp always draws a laugh... until I crank the dial over and shred some faces.For the price, you can likely afford to pick up $40 worth of guitar/speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig.  And, for the price, this is a solid 4 star amp.  I know I'm happy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid tiny amp at a great price.", "unixReviewTime": 1349136000, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2012"},

Most of the B. pedals work quite well. I have no quality issues with them. Some people complain about the plastic cases, but they are tough and reliable unless you're in the habit of abusing your pedals by smashing them around or can't control your &#34;stomp&#34; pressure. Some are better than others, and this one works perfectly. I have 6 B. pedals (one of them is a tuner), and each seems to add some noise to the amp output, especially when it is in quiescent mode (no signal input).This pedal, placed at the end of the line just before the signal goes into the amp, quiets all that noise that the other pedals generate. I had to check this, because I at first thought my amp was making the noise, but when I bypassed all the pedals, my amp was quiet, which was a relief. Then I needed relief from the pedal noise, and this did the trick.The controls are a little misleading, but easy to get used to and adjust. The &#34;send-receive&#34; function is for quieting the noise you send to an additional effects pedal, which seems pointless, as the best way to use this is to put it at the end of the chain to quiet all the effects.The mute function may help, but when I turn on my pedal tuner, this also functions as a mute.I had to do a little modification of the B. pedal board to make this fit in, as I already had 6 pedals in place. But, with the removal of a couple of screws, it fit into a slot meant for a longer pedal.I don't actually need the on-off function on this most of the time, so placing it in that sideways, out of the way spot was no disadvantage. I just leave it on all the time so it always quiets the noise when I'm not actually playing. However, I can still operate it if necessary, for example for the mute function if I needed that.It's aggravating to have to have a pedal to eliminate noise from other pedals, but at least there is an easy solution in a noise gate like this one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works great to correct other pedal noise", "unixReviewTime": 1397088000, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2014"},

(I actually bought three of them.)I crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.Two great tips in one:Use a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in!Throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.Don't worry about the &#34;thing&#34; hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip.The humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.If you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything &#34;built up&#34; to require extensive cleaning or replacement.Keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge.Try to keep the sponge moist when it's dry.I strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1&#34; X 4&#34; costing around 17-20 bucks.This will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.Remember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!If you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse...dead & broken!Hope this helps!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works Fine & Much Better Than Nothing!", "unixReviewTime": 1390262400, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2014"},

First off if you are planning on buying the US-322 don't. Buy its bigger brother the US-366. Getting an optical connection and additional ins and outs for such a little bit more money, as well as 192k makes it a no-brainer. To get optical (on the 366 only) at this price is great, but the A/D D/A converters leave a bit to be desired. On the other hand the mic pres are pretty good, have distortion ratings, THD of only 0.0045% and with 24 Bit/192KHz recording make these the best sounding interfaces put out by Tascam to date.What I meant by a compromise is that even with interfaces that cost 3 to 5 times this price most of them have either good mic pres, and weak clocks, or vice versa, and some work with Windows but not so well with MAC and once again vice versa, etc. I researched interfaces for a long, long time, and considering non-crash reliability and a dozen other factors I finally sprung for anRME Fireface UFX USB 2.0 or Firewire High Performance audio interface 30 in, 30 out. Now that's an interface. I have been running it with Pro Tools 9 since 2011.Pro Tools 10- Professional audio recording and music creation softwareis out and Pro Tools 11 is now being released.So if you are looking for an inexpensive interface expect some compromises in one area or another. Rather than slam it out with performance specs under a microscope, I would rather provide a review helping those who are interested in setting up this Tascam US-322 or 366 so you can save a lot of time trying to figure it out. Sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved. So what I did was load, and register the free and included Cubase LE6 complete with activation and eLicense registration and installation as well as installing the Tascam driver, and doing updates for both. I know a lot of the reviews here just downloaded a driver and used their existing DAW in order to test out the interface, and therefore they didn't need to spend much time with it. I don't blame them; the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. So get out a cup of coffee because installing this complete package doesn't happen in just one hour. So here goes...If you have Windows Vista you are probably out of luck because the system requirements list Windows XP, 7, and 8. I am sure the omission of Vista is not a mistake. I know myLogitech AudioHub Notebook Speakersare non-functional in my Vista laptop if you are running Windows Media Center in it as well. It works in Win 7 just fine. So I installed it in my desktop running Windows 7 64 bit and it gives you the option of installing in 32 or 64. In addition to Cubase LE 6 it also installed AI Elements 6 as well as Agent One Content, Groove Agent One, Vintage Beat Boxes, Steinberg Drum Loop Expansion 01 which took a good amount of time to load, as well as Steinberg Halion Sonic SE 64 bit for AI Elements. I then had to activate and register Cubase LE6 which involves installing the latest eLcc, creating a Steinberg account (which is free and they don't ask you for a credit card). They provide you with an activation code after you register.I have an iLok for Pro Tools which is a USB device that enables you to run the program. Cubase does not require that you have one, although they have an equivalent looking device, but fortunately they have a software based equivalent. They do this with an eLicense which you will then update to version 6.5.4.1122. There is an eLicense control setup and you have a Soft eLicenser number that you will use in order to generate the Activation Code generated at the Steinberg site. What came on my disc was version 6.05 which they instruct you to immediately do an update, which I did to version 6.07.So we install the Tascam interface next which comes on a separate DVD. Included with the interface is a 5 foot USB printer style cable. You will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer. Windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver. So install the driver off of the disc first, and then do the update. It took at least 15 minutes to do that update. What flashed on the screen was 154 megabytes and then all you see is an install screen with a scrolling series of round objects moving. At first it says, \"This is going to take a long time\", and they were exactly right. It almost tempts you to think something is wrong, because nothing is happening other than the scrolling, and then finally after ten minutes or so a dialogue box comes up and says, \"Do you want to install?\" and you click continue, and then it comes up again in another minute, and this happens a few times, and then finally it changes over to an installation finished box. (I have Verizon FIOS and usually download huge amount of data in a flash). Then you reboot.Now this is important. Plug the US-322 directly into an available USB 2.0 port and not into a hub, even if it is a powered hub. It simply won't work. I tried it and the light wouldn't even come on indicating USB. When I went direct the interface lit up and it worked. The manuals also warn you not to use it with USB 1.1. The US-322 comes with a printed Quick Start Guide. There is also an owner's manual for both the Interface, and Cubase that are available either on the DVD, or by Googling the same and they come up as a PDF download. If you are new to setting up interfaces be prepared to do a good deal of reading. There is a driver to choose, input and output settings, as well as going into Windows Control Panel/Sound in order to choose the interface for playback, and recording. If you're new to these kinds of setups just take your time, and don't be dismayed if something doesn't work. All it takes is for one button to get pushed and Wahlah you have sound. For example in Cubase there is a monitoring button without it you won't get any sound from the headphones. If all else fails you can go to the Tascam web site by Googling Tascam US-322 and then click on the support tab, and they have a \"you pay for it\" phone call number in order to help you. Hope this helps.PS: The real killer deal right now is Avid Pro Tools 9 bundle with the MBox Mini which is another limited interface but you are getting Pro Tools 9. Plus purchases of this bundle made after 10/2011 that has pro tools 9 will be able to have a free upgrade to pro tools 10 if you register your product with Avid. Considering what Pro Tools goes for by itself, and what the MBox sells for individually, and the bundle even comes with the iLok you can sell it used for what you are paying for it, and even more than you are paying for it if you take advantage of the discounts I have seen pop up as much as 20% off the already low price. Then you have Pro Tools 9, and 10 full blown versions, none of this LE stuff, and an interface, and can grow from there. This Tascam interface works great with Pro Tools. These Pro Tools 9 bundles are discounted to make way for 11, and I am seeing music stores running out of them. They are clearing the shelves preparing for 11, but it has bugs. I rarely purchase totally new versions until they have time to season some, and get feedback from users. After some time, and more updates, I will be browsing the shelves for discounts on the upgrade to 11; maybe in another year. PT 9 is all I need.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Setup Tips.

All the mics that I had previously tried at this price point and lower, including Blue's \"Snow\" line, sounded overly treblish, with pronounced sibilance (listen to the comparison-contrast provided by the first reviewer in his video demonstration).  By contrast, the Yeti is rich and resonant, and its sensitivity permits using it without benefit of a pop filter.  Short of spending 4-5 times more, I'm convinced this is the best option in my particular case.At the same time, as a musician without a home studio I seriously doubt I'll make much use of the mic for performance or recording.  As far as performance goes, the very size and conspicuousness of the unit could compromise presentation, upstaging the performer (at least a vocalist with a normal-sized head).  And for traveling purposes, I've found the Sansom Go mic to be the best fit with a laptop computer (even though Blue's literature shows the Yeti alongside a laptop).Blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product.  Its size and weight are likely to attract buyers as well as provoke reservations--perhaps leading some purchasers to complement what strikes me as a home studio mic with one or more of Blue's lighter, more compact microphones.  Its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility.  But as other reviewers have mentioned, the volume, gain, and pattern knobs are rather loose, allowing for lateral and vertical as well as the expected rotating movement.  The knobs turn effortlessly but not with the ball-bearing smoothness one might associate with ultra expensive professional equipment. There's the slightest hint of resistance at one point in the gain control's circular movement, but it's not at the 12 o'clock position, so it's difficult to say whether or not the knob is intended to have a mid-point for quick and easy assessment of positioning.In sum, the Yeti should please anyone who wants to broadcast or record a fuller and richer sound than that previously attainable with comparably-priced mics, and it should prove a useful (not to mention handsome) addition to any home studio.  It's still a bit early to make any pronouncements about the worthiness of this imposing metal humanoid as a road warrior.  It's main competitor on Amazon--the Audio Technica AT2020--is pint-sized compared to the Yeti, and I'll confess I'm still not sure whether I made the best choice (the 2 mics have been alternating in the 1 and 2 slots of best-selling mics on Amazon for 3 months now).  I wish there were some direct reviewer comparisons to indicate whether the AT's relative compactness and light weight come at a compromise--however slight--to audio quality.[I experienced initial hesitancy on Yeti's part to make an appearance in the Input and Output panels (in System Preferences) of my iMac. Then I read the instructions, which discourage plugging the mic into a hub. Plugged directly into a USB port on my computer, Yeti immediately sprang into action. My hunch is that a good, powered 4-port hub would be equally effective.]", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Blue Yeti vs. AT2020?", "unixReviewTime": 1272585600, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2010"},

I placed it in the effects loop of both a Palomino V8 (USA/Ampeg made) and a Crate VC508 (a 5 watt USA made EL84 tube amp with Celestian speaker) and it was transformative to both amps' tone (in a great way). It does very well with single coils.  It's a pedal that I would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in.  I don't think it works as well when I run my LP into a Jet City combo - particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures / harmonics.

Hawkins \"HumanJHawkins\"", "helpful": [7, 9], "reviewText": "I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1\" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Disappointing Quality and Engineering", "unixReviewTime": 1306886400, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2011"},

But what was Ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem, including the pick clip and tuner holder, protude outward away from the fingerboard? It's awkward to apply and remove quickly. It's visually distracting for player and audience, and it doesn't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.The only possible justification I can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck -  but even that doesn't fly. Regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and, unless you're avoiding playing that first fret (or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position) you're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand. I own the older Planet Waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.Otherwise the construction of the NS Artist Capo is superb. The surface is arched, probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various Strat fingerboards as well as a flatter SG/LP style. It doesn't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM-1 which is virtually the same as a classical. If I cranked the tension it's possible the rubber would flatten out but I wouldn't risk marring the neck wood.I tried both the pick and tuner clips and they're functional, but to be honest I wouldn't use either - too distracting and I only use tuners to get an initial A, then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments, depending on what they are.The only other capo I've ever used that protudes outward is the Kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence' design. I have one and, as good as the holding action is, I've never felt comfortable with the design. The older Planet Waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.To top off the confusion, the picture on the front of the cardboard card the NS Artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that's impossible with this capo!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Bizarre Variant of the older Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo", "unixReviewTime": 1398297600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2014"},

It is barely workable for two.It is easy to set up, but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place. And you absolutely  have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.The best thing these stands are built for are V Type guitars such as my Jackson Rhoads as long as you can put them back to back. For Les Paul and Strat type axes, their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow, stick like feet of the stand, especially when they are new. You can't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible. So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand. If you just gotta buy something from On Stage, get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced. But really, you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.This is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "A Complete Joke", "unixReviewTime": 1309392000, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2011"},
